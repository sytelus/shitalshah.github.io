      <title>Moving from dasBlog to WordPress</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/p/welcome-to-shitalshah-com-v4/&#34;&gt;written earlier&lt;/a&gt; why I decided to move my site to WordPress instead choosing Jekyll or keep updating my custom code. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll go in to some details on how I moved to WordPress with the hope that others might have easier time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I&amp;rsquo;d decided to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://dasblog.codeplex.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dasBlog&lt;/a&gt; because it was fairly minimal and hackable. In the end I modified dasBlog in such a way that it would be hard to tell for normal users where my own code ended and dasBlog started. As it happens with so many open source projects, people moved on and now this project isn&amp;rsquo;t even updated since 2012. So please move on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;installing-wordpress&#34;&gt;Installing WordPress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I still have some legacy ASP.Net code so I decided to host WordPress on IIS. Fortunately famous 5-minute installation claims does holds on Windows as well. You just install it through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microsoft Web Platform Installer&lt;/a&gt; (WebPI)� and off you go, well, except few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s best to� install and test everything on your� local machine first and then move it to web host. By default WebPI uses WebMatrix server but you might want to use full IIS with all its goodies for experimentation. There are plenty of instructions on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peterviola.com/installing-iis-8-on-windows-8/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;installing IIS on Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search for WordPress in WebPI and choose WordPress product that has WordPress logo, avoid variants such as Brandoo. In WebPI, make sure you click on options:
&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-1407&#34; src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIOptionsButton.png&#34; alt=&#34;WebPIOptionsButton&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;292&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIOptionsButton.png 896w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIOptionsButton-300x175.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the options screen you should select these options:&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-1406&#34; src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIOptionsScreen.png&#34; alt=&#34;WebPIOptionsScreen&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;343&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIOptionsScreen.png 875w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIOptionsScreen-300x205.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When WordPress installation dialog comes up select New Web Site instead of using default (its a good practice!) and specify some local folder� for all WordPress files. &lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIWordPressOptions.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIWordPressOptions.png&#34; alt=&#34;WebPIWordPressOptions&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-1409&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIWordPressOptions.png 875w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WebPIWordPressOptions-300x205.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start IIS, stop Default site and start wordpress site. Navigate to localhost, fill in username, password and you should be able to log on to brand new WordPress website!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would highly recommend that you move WordPress installation to a subfolder instead of keeping it in the root. This has several advantages. First,� you keep WordPress files separate so during updates there are no worries for overwriting your own stuff in root. Second, in root folder your can host your own code or override WordPress behavior using URL redirects. Finally, this arrangement allows you to host other Web applications and sub-sites in to its own folders sitting next to WordPress. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;instructions are very easy&lt;/a&gt; and your external WordPress URLs don&amp;rsquo;t change by doing this.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are few essential settings you want to no set: Timezone in Settings &amp;gt; General and url formats in Settings &amp;gt; Permalinks. For permalinks I used the Custom� Structure with value &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/p/%postname%/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;exporting-from-dasblog&#34;&gt;Exporting from dasBlog&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to migrate posts and comments from dasBlog is using &lt;a href=&#34;http://merill.net/2008/03/dasblog-to-blogml-converter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DasBlogML tool&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately it seem to have gotten lost from Web altogether after MSDN folks decided to reorganize few things. I&amp;rsquo;ve put the� copy I used on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/DasBlogML&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and for me the process went smoothly without errors. If you do encounter some issues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.schrankmonster.de/2009/09/22/dasblog-to-wordpress-migration/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://nixmash.com/on-wordpress/net-to-wordpress-migrating-blogengine-net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://bobcravens.com/2010/11/hello-wordpress-good-bye-dasblog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.little.org/blog/tips-tricks/migrating-from-dasblog-to-wordpress/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; out there for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;importing-to-wordpress&#34;&gt;Importing to WordPress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While WordPress doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any built-in way to import BlogML content, there is a plugin &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/plugins/blogml-importer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BlogML Importer&lt;/a&gt;. Again, this plugin hasn&amp;rsquo;t been maintained and is broken with current version of WordPress. So I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/blogml-wordpress-import&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;forked it on GitHub and updated it with the fix&lt;/a&gt;. You just need to install original plugin and overwrite files I&amp;rsquo;ve on repository. Also look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://casadevega.com/index.php/2010/02/01/importing-blogml-to-wordpress/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cleaning-up-the-markup&#34;&gt;Cleaning Up the Markup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the period I&amp;rsquo;d use quite a few tools to post to my blogs and some of these produced a really messed up HTML. So one thing I needed was to clean up the markup in my posts. The Tidy2 plugin that can be downloaded from within &lt;a href=&#34;http://notepad-plus-plus.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt; is a godsend for this purpose. However you might need to invest significant time in configuring it. I&amp;rsquo;ve put the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/MiscDevFiles/blob/master/source/devutils/tidy1.cfg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tidy2 config&lt;/a&gt; that I tweaked for hours at Github. This config is fairly robust and does good job at cleaning bad markup in HTML fragments, even those awful MS Word extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;managing-redirects-for-the-old-links&#34;&gt;Managing Redirects for the Old Links&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I care about a lot is making sure that links on my website remains valid during the moves. I&amp;rsquo;ve practically obsessed over this even if this website is not popular and there are hardly any old links out there pointing back here. But still, I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/301_redirect&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;301 redirects&lt;/a&gt; from all the way back from year 2000 so even those links remains valid today after 3 major technology stack changes. With &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/using-rewrite-maps-in-url-rewrite-module&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IIS Rewrite Maps&lt;/a&gt; things have become much more easier. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I did: Create a file that looks like below with list of URLs for individual posts dumped from the DasBlogML tool plus others you add manually. For categories you should have one URL for each category in dasBlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;rewriteMaps&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;rewriteMap name=&#34;ShitalShahV3Redirects&#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- redirects for the pages --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/aboutme.asp&#34; value=&#34;/about/author/&#34;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/aboutme.aspx&#34; value=&#34;/about/author/&#34;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- etc --&amp;gt;
        
&amp;lt;!-- 401s detected from Google Webmaster tools --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/?s=CategoryView.aspx&#34; value=&#34;/p/category/&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/blog/CategoryView.aspx&#34; value=&#34;/p/category/&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/?s=content/AllComments.xml&#34; value=&#34;/comments/feed/&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/?s=CommentView.aspx&#34; value=&#34;/comments/feed/&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/blog/content/AllComments.xml&#34; value=&#34;/comments/feed/&#34; /&amp;gt;
        
&amp;lt;!-- redirects for the feeds --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/blog/SyndicationService.asmx/GetRss&#34; value=&#34;/feed/&#34;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/blog/SyndicationService.asmx/GetAtom&#34; value=&#34;/feed/atom/&#34;/&amp;gt;
        
&amp;lt;!-- Redirects for categories --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/blog/CategoryView.aspx?category=AI&#34; value=&#34;/p/category/machine-learning/&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;add key=&#34;/blog/CategoryView.aspx?category=Announcement&#34; value=&#34;/p/category/personal-news/&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- etc --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/rewriteMap&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/rewriteMaps&amp;gt;            
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        

&lt;p&gt;Now you can put reference above map in your web.config. Below example also takes care of other URL patterns that dasBlog had. This however does not take care of guid based URLs that dasBlog had as permalinks. Unfortunately its just too much effort to mine theme and map them to new WordPress URLs. I used Google Webmaster Tools to find external guid links that were getting 404s. For me there were only couple so it was a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;system.webServer&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;rewrite&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!--Include the map --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;rewriteMaps configSource=&#34;ShitalShahV3Redirects.config&#34; /&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;rules&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;!-- If we find match in the map then just that --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;rule name=&#34;dasBlogTitleRedirects&#34; stopProcessing=&#34;true&#34;&amp;gt;  
        &amp;lt;match url=&#34;(.*)&#34; /&amp;gt;  
        &amp;lt;conditions&amp;gt;  
            &amp;lt;add input=&#34;{ShitalShahV3Redirects:{REQUEST_URI}}&#34; pattern=&#34;(.+)&#34; /&amp;gt;  
        &amp;lt;/conditions&amp;gt;  
        &amp;lt;action type=&#34;Redirect&#34; url=&#34;{C:1}&#34; appendQueryString=&#34;false&#34; redirectType=&#34;Permanent&#34; /&amp;gt;  
    &amp;lt;/rule&amp;gt;                   
    
    &amp;lt;!-- Redirects for various URL patterns that dasBlog provided --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;!-- date based URLs --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;rule name=&#34;dasBlogDateRedirect&#34; stopProcessing=&#34;true&#34;&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;conditions&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;add input=&#34;{QUERY_STRING}&#34; pattern=&#34;(?:^|&amp;amp;)date=(\d+)-(\d+)-(\d+)(?:&amp;amp;|$)&#34; /&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;action type=&#34;Redirect&#34; url=&#34;/p/{C:1}/{C:2}/{C:3}/&#34; appendQueryString=&#34;false&#34; redirectType=&#34;Permanent&#34; /&amp;gt;  
    &amp;lt;/rule&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;rule name=&#34;dasBlogMonthRedirect&#34; stopProcessing=&#34;true&#34;&amp;gt;  
        &amp;lt;match url=&#34;^blog(.*)&#34; /&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;/conditions&amp;gt;                                     
        &amp;lt;action type=&#34;Redirect&#34; url=&#34;/p/{C:1}/{C:2}/&#34; appendQueryString=&#34;false&#34; redirectType=&#34;Permanent&#34; /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/rewrite&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/system.webServer&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
        

&lt;h4 id=&#34;themes-plugins-pages-commenting-and-general-organization&#34;&gt;Themes, Plugins, Pages, Commenting and General Organization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write more detailed post on how to find programmer-friendly themes and essential plugins to make WordPress more hackable in a separate post (the short answer is I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/themes/decode&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Decode for the theme&lt;/a&gt;). However eventually question will come and haunt you if you should use page or post for X where X = photo albums or your projects or articles and so on. I eventually settled on the principle to use post for pretty much everything except for few rare cases such as About and Disclaimer. The primary reason is that posts can be categorized which ultimately appears as navbar on my website. Also I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped treating posts as immutable pieces of textual stream that they were decade ago in RSS word. Instead I look at them as evolving articles that gets refreshed as new information becomes available. Just that underlying principle has helped me to clear up my mind about using posts as opposed to pages for most scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided not to write my own gallery code or use WordPress&amp;rsquo;s built-in option (which I think is pretty bad). The thing is that photo galleries are finally becoming sophisticated enough that just like blog engines they would take a lot of your time to do them really well. That&amp;rsquo;s the time you could have been working on more interesting problems. So I left hosting of photo galleries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/photos/+ShitalShahdotcom&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PicasaWeb&lt;/a&gt; (with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sytelus/sets&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; - they are offering whooping 1TB for free!). The way this would work is I will simply create a post for new albums that will have description and link to PicasaWeb and/or Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing to get rid of is hosting my projects, binaries and code on my website. Github has evolved to be an obvious choice to browse, view and download so there is now little point in creating my own stuff to do the same thing. So again, the strategy is to create a post for each new project that points to my repos on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I also decided to dump built-in commenting system of WordPress. For an experiment I&amp;rsquo;d left it turned on for few weeks and I got 150 spam comments. It&amp;rsquo;s huge pain to clean that up and disappointing that even in 2014 WordPress out-of-box comment system is just not usable. There are plugins like Akismet but its not completely free. The next obvious option was Disqus. They have proven that they can scale, they are robust, have great community support and &lt;em&gt;most importantly&lt;/em&gt;, they allow exporting all your data so you can switch to something else if you want to. Despite of all these positives, I did encountered few unhappy moments. For example, current markup injected by Disqus actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t validate for HTML5. This is super bad for product that is almost viral. I contacted their support which apparently didn&amp;rsquo;t consider that was an alarming issue and asked me to post it in their community forums where all their devs handout. Huh? Why can&amp;rsquo;t their support &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; forward it to their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; devs instead of me having to find them in their public forums?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;where-do-you-host-this-thing&#34;&gt;Where Do You Host This Thing?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d WebHost4Life as my hosting provider for very long time. However recently they have been going downhill. Their control panel is ancient and a mess of Frankenstein apps. They haven&amp;rsquo;t yet gotten around to supporting latest versions of .Net, IIS and so on. Just doing FTP on their servers gave me nightmares by frequent errors and disconnections. Plus their prices are no longer competitive. So I took this opportunity to check out all the cloud providers. It turns out that none of the popular providers (Amazon, Rackspace, Azure) has a viable option for low traffic website like this one at a price that is comparable to something like WebHost4Life (while Azure has option for free website, they don&amp;rsquo;t allow custom domains). Even after recent price cuts from Google, Azure and Amazon hosting website like this can easily cost $30 per month and that&amp;rsquo;s with severe limitations on bandwidth, storage and compute. So I reverted back to finding regular web hosts and zeroed in to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smarterasp.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SmarterAsp.net&lt;/a&gt; folks. These guys are just great. They really have very modern control panel, nice support, easy to manage emails, multiple websites, databases, FTP and so on. Plus their advertised storage and bandwidth is unlimited which had been my primary criteria even though it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that in practice. I just don&amp;rsquo;t want my users to see errors &amp;ldquo;This website has exceeded its bandwidth quota&amp;rdquo; ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;deploying-to-production&#34;&gt;Deploying to Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally its time to move your localhost WordPress installation to actual web host. How do you do it? It turns out that there is no built-in easy way. Sure, you can export your content as archive and import somewhere else but what about all the themes and plugins and customizations you had been doing all along? Fortunately there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fantastic WordPress plugin called Duplicator&lt;/a&gt; that worked like a charm in my case. It moved everything without a hitch to my actual server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Surviving Windows 8 First Encounter</title>

      <guid>http://shital.com/p/surviving-windows-8-first-encounter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After installing Windows 8 you might quickly find yourself at unease at doing few things the old way or “cornering” the mouse too much. The answer to your frustration is keyboard shortcuts! There are many but below are the ones that would save the day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&#34;sheet&#34;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + D
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Jump to Desktop mode
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Switch between Start screen and last app
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + Q
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Search Apps
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + W
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Search Settings
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + X
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      A popup menu for power users� (Command Prompt, Control Panel, File Explorer, Computer Management etc)
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Alt + F4
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Close app (Metro app doesn’t have close button)
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + E
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Open explorer
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + R
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      The good old Run dialog
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + C
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Open Charms bar (allows you to quickly go to Settings and Search options for the app)
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Page Up/Down
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Move around tiles on Start screen
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Ctrl+Shift+Esc
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Task Manager
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + Tab
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Recent Metro apps
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Right Click on Tile
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Options for uninstall, pin, unpin, size etc
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + Z or Right Click inside Metro App
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Show App specific bar (for example, open file, play button etc)
    &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      Windows + .
    &lt;/td&gt;
    
    &lt;td&gt;
      Snap metro app on left
    &lt;/td&gt;

      <title>Groups, Places and Collectives for Makers in Seattle Area</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/groups-places-and-collectives-for-makers-in-seattle-area/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2012 07:14:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/groups-places-and-collectives-for-makers-in-seattle-area/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We went to Mini Makers Faire in Seattle today and one of most surprising thing I learned was how abundant are the local&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;resources for hackers and makers! Reminded me of geek fairy tales of &lt;a href= &#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew\_Computer\_Club&#34;&gt;Homebrew Computer Club&lt;/a&gt; that you often hear. Here are some of the things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you want to check out if you are interested in making stuff and live in Seattle area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://metrixcreatespace.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Metrix Create: Space&lt;/a&gt; – I think this was the coolest thing I came to know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a shop with everything from sewing machine to electronics. They run lots of interesting &lt;a href= &#34;http://wiki.metrixcreatespace.com/workshops&#34;&gt;workshops &amp;amp; classes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s your neighborhood fab lab!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.makeseattle.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Make Seattle Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt; – Regular meet ups for Arduino/electronics makers and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learners to exchange ideas and get help on your projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wstoollibrary.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;West Seattle Tools Library&lt;/a&gt; – I thought this was the coolest concept. They have a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;collection of 1500 tools that you can checkout for your projects. Just look at their &lt;a href= &#34;http://wstoollibrary.org/category/education/tool-of-the-week/&#34;&gt;tool of the week&lt;/a&gt; series. There is also &lt;a href= &#34;http://wsfixers.org/&#34;&gt;Fixers Collective&lt;/a&gt; who meet up at Tools Library and would be happy to fix your broken stuff or just&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tinker around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Xbot Robotics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop Space]&lt;a href=&#34;http://xbotrobotics.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=51&amp;amp;Itemid=58&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; – They provide you space to work on your projects along with access to almost everything you need such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;power tools, soldering stations, oscilloscopes, electronics components, drill presses, sand blasters, table saws, sanders,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;grinders!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few of cool things we saw there everything from [The&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain Machine]&lt;a href=&#34;http://ladyada.net/make/brain/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logos-electro.com/zigduino/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zigduino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href= &#34;http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/06/11/montys_robot/&#34;&gt;Lifesuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href= &#34;http://www.marginallyclever.com/category/drawbot-my-creations/&#34;&gt;Drawbots&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href= &#34;http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Most-Useless-Machine/&#34;&gt;The Most Useless Machine Ever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also jotted down the next classes I want to do at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pratt.org/classes.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pratt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href= &#34;http://www.allmetalarts.org/classes/&#34;&gt;All Metal Arts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tomato Firmware for Router and Comcast Cable Modem</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/tomato-firmware-for-router-and-comcast-cable-modem/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2009 07:41:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/tomato-firmware-for-router-and-comcast-cable-modem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a note… if you have Tomato installed as firmware in the router and Comcast cable internet then try followings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnect cable modem and router and wait until their lights go off. For Comcast modem it takes fair bit of time because of internal battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Internet connection is still lost then connect your computer directly to cable modem. If this doesn’t work then you need to call Comcast at 1-800-COMCAST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If above works then the problem is that your router isn’t syncing with cable model. To confirm this, log in to router login page usual &lt;a href=&#34;http://192.168.(0/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://192.168.(0&lt;/a&gt; or 1).1. See the status in overview. If this status is &amp;ldquo;Renewing…&amp;rdquo; and never changes then disconnect cable co-axial wire going to model. Turn off cable model. After all LEDs goes off turn it back on. Reconnect cable co-ax to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How to Right Align Address in Word Document</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/how-to-right-align-address-in-word-document/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2009 08:33:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/how-to-right-align-address-in-word-document/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;May be the silliest thing but how do you align address on the right side of a letter in Microsoft Word 2010? Select the text you need and then click on that little square in Ribbon bar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2009/10/image_2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2009/10/image_2-300x275.png&#34; alt=&#34;image_2&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;275&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-702&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image_2-300x275.png 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image_2.png 435w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type amount of indentation you need. It’s typically 5” for letter size:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2009/10/image_4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2009/10/image_4-300x219.png&#34; alt=&#34;image_4&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;219&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-704&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image_4-300x219.png 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image_4.png 640w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you have right aligned address!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2009/10/image_6.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2009/10/image_6-300x140.png&#34; alt=&#34;image_6&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;140&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-706&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image_6-300x140.png 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image_6.png 640w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intel Xeon – the worse branding ever?</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/intel-xeon-the-worse-branding-ever/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Aug 2009 00:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/intel-xeon-the-worse-branding-ever/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is really frustrating if you didn’t knew. Intel likes to call many of their processors for “business class” systems “Xeon”. When they say Xeon it can mean anything from those dinosaurs based on Pentium II and the latest and greatest ones based on on Core i7. So when you see a system built with Xeon processor you really need to look up its exact subtle number and carefully study its specs to figure out what it really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ark.intel.com/Compare.aspx?ids=39718,37147,&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Xeon W3520 is same as latest Core i7-920&lt;/a&gt;, including the price. The only difference between two is Xeon supports ECC memory. So what’s the point in branding this processor as Xeon instead of Core 2 i7?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, new Intel Core i7 series is definitely a winner and finally makes 2 year old Intel Core 2 series actually obsolete. This processor can execute 8 threads simultaneously and supports 3 channels for DDR3 access tripling the RAM bandwidth! Best of all, it costs more or less same as older Core 2 processors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solving Shared Notebook Sync Issue With OneNote 2010</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/solving-shared-notebook-sync-issue-with-onenote-2010/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2009 10:55:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/solving-shared-notebook-sync-issue-with-onenote-2010/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since about 3 years we used Groove to share calendar, notes and files within family – until I discovered a feature in OneNote called “Shared Notebooks”. The Shared Notebooks are just like any other OneNote notebooks with a difference that they get synced with other people! If someone added new note or modified a note you get it next time and vice a versa. On conflicts it created new pages and also you can take automated backups. This feature requires either file share or SharePoint. So I’ve now got my personal SharePoint website on Internet (which costs $10 per year) to host our shared OneNotes as well as our shared calendar that gets synced in Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately in OneNote 2010 Technical Preview, the sync stopped working because OneNote for some reason does not popup a dialog to ask for a password to connect to SharePoint website on Internet anymore. Very troublesome. But here’s the work around I’ve found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on the Notebook, select Properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on Change Location button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type URL of your SharePoint website. This will popup password dialog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancel all dialogs and sync! It should work now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>So, which digital photo frame is the best?</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/so-which-digital-photo-frame-is-the-best/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2008 10:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/so-which-digital-photo-frame-is-the-best/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are in the market to look for Digital photo frames this note will hopefully save you some time. It&amp;rsquo;s really frustrating to buy one of this when selection is so large. This is very nice Christmas gift to your loved ones. I take lots of photographs but rarely have time to actually see them. So they are excellent gadget even if you want to buy for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest feature in new frames is wireless connectivity to Internet. You can throw RSS feed from flickr or other photo sharing websites and the frame will download the new photos automatically. Some frames would even allow you to specify tags in Flickr for the photos you want to see in frame. So imagine your parents or grandpa suddenly see your trip photos in their photo frame as it is occurring! This the way photo sharing is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two major services that most of these digital frames supports: &lt;a href=&#34;http://frameit.live.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Windows Live FrameIt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.framechannel.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FrameChannel&lt;/a&gt;. These services helps deliver even more stuff like weather and news in your frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few vendors offering these types of frame. Some of the current models (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2008&lt;/sub&gt;) are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Kodak-EasyShare-W1020-10-Inch-Wireless/dp/B0016NOTOI/ref=wl_it_dp?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;coliid=IY8LFHFUZVOR7&amp;amp;colid=29A7YSXW6L4G7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kodak EasyShare Frames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of choices! To make filtering easier I would suggest to eliminate anything below 15&amp;rdquo; size. Those sizes (8&amp;rdquo; and 10&amp;rdquo;) are typically only useful if you want to put frame on the desk just couple of fit away from you. Also frames below 15&amp;rdquo; will have resolution of 800X600 at best which is not all that good. Even the low end laptops have 15&amp;rdquo; screen and run at 1028X768 so you can put your laptop where you want to place frame and see how it looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In above bunch so far only two frames are 15&amp;rdquo; or bigger. One from Digital Spectrum and another from PhotoVu. The PhotoVu ones are actually even larger and really expensive ($700+) so for most people only descent choice may be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/490897-REG/Digital_Spectrum_U_40118_MemoryVue_MF_8115_15_Premium.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Digital Spectrum MemoryVue MF-8115&lt;/a&gt;. There you go, that&amp;rsquo;s the best value frame as of Thanksgiving 2008!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the future? Actually if you look at of lot of deals around you will see that LCD displays as big as 22&amp;rdquo; can now be bought for under $170. So I would predict that bigger frames especially in 15&amp;rdquo; to 19&amp;rdquo; range would be under $200 by Thanksgiving 2009. Most of above manufacturers who still don&amp;rsquo;t have 15&amp;rdquo; models would probably have them pretty soon. Another important note is that life space of LCD frames is not very huge. Most manufacturers aren&amp;rsquo;t releasing this data but depending on brightness levels it can be as low as 20,000 hours. Now that comes out to just above 2 years. So don&amp;rsquo;t consider these frames as your long term investments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do you really need 1080i or 1080p or 1440p?</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/do-you-really-need-1080i-or-1080p-or-1440p/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.burnyourbonus.info/hdtv-faq/faq3.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; basically says that if you have 50&amp;rdquo; TV and you are watching it at about 9&amp;rsquo; of distance then 720p has all the resolution human eye with &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; vision can ever see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently we use 80X40 screen through our Panasonic projector PT-AX100U. Now that&amp;rsquo;s equal to almost 4 of your tiny 50&amp;rdquo; screens so certainly 720p won&amp;rsquo;t be enough at our current viewing distance of 10&amp;rsquo; (our current screen size is limited because of wall size and I think the projector is perfectly capable of going up to 100&amp;rdquo; diagonal). Actually at that size looks like even 1080p won&amp;rsquo;t be enough. The 1080 runs out its steam at just 76&amp;rdquo; screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now we will probably stick with our 720p projector though. The 1080p projectors are still super expensive right now($2500+)! Whoever said current HD technology is &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, this dearly missed shell context menu item is now available again in Windows Vista, thanks to Mark Russinovich. This little new utility is a new addition to Sysinternals toolset and can be &lt;a href=&#34;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc300361.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;. Just run ShellRunAs /reg to register context menu for Shell &amp;ldquo;Run as different user&amp;rdquo;. This menu will then be available in Start menu items as well as Windows Explorer right clicks :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://shital.com/p/phun-with-physics-simulations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This addictive program can easily keep you busy for rest of the weekend so be careful :). &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phun.at/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Phun&lt;/a&gt; is a physics simulator that even kids can use and its absolutely a delight. I watched the video and had to immediately download to give it a try. At first the interface might seem not as easy but after reading tutorial in main page and forums, you might be able to accomplish everything shown in video in less than 15 min of learning curve! Simply the easiest, powerful and most fun physics program I’ve come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go Left Handed For Mouse</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/go-left-handed-for-mouse/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2005 21:10:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/go-left-handed-for-mouse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I observed how unequally I use my right and left hands. It’s not because I don’t type with my both hands but it’s because I use only the right hand in maneuvering and clicking the mouse. Considering the number of clicks I make per day, this huge lack of load-balancing is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifehacker.com/software/life-hacks/how-to-avoid-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-101679.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;terrible&lt;/a&gt;! So I switched the mouse on left hand and it’s been great (reminds me the first time I hold the mouse) except that my mouse is curved so it’s comfortable only on right hand. I guess I’m gonna get a new mouse which is left+right handed, wireless (easy to switch hands), optical and at least 5 buttons. Don’t forget to reverse the mouse buttons in control panel! This is really fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, besides those &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ergonomics.com.au/howtosit.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sitting posture tips&lt;/a&gt;, I think the one factor that strongly affects your creativity at work is how far you can look from your desk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A New NewsGator Online Convert</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/a-new-newsgator-online-convert/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2004 21:12:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/a-new-newsgator-online-convert/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any software that isn&amp;rsquo;t open source AND also isn&amp;rsquo;t evolving fast enough to keep up with their customers should be seen with the sign &amp;ldquo;Stay Away&amp;rdquo;. These things gets in to your computer in the name of easing up your tasks and it indeed appears so for a while until you just run of out its capacity and start spending most of the time in just managing it or dealing with information overload. &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/p/continual-survival-of-sharpreader/&#34;&gt;Sharpreader&lt;/a&gt; is the one. Windows is another. While my desktop will soon have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mandrakelinux.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linux Mandrake&lt;/a&gt; distribution, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will still solve the problem because Linux is open source but it ain&amp;rsquo;t fast enough to evolve, in my view. But finally I was able to take care of SharpReader. Check out the free and cool &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsgator.com/ngs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NewsGator Online Edition&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m a convert since last two weeks and I like its not-large-but-effective featureset which includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows to rate posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows to clip posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows to share your clips using RSS (which you can eventually save on your hard drive for archival purpose).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows to share your OPML in real time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need of syncing news readers on different boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty cool non-interuptive Web UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features #1 and #2 are essential in dealing with information overload. I&amp;rsquo;ve also categorized &lt;a href=&#34;http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/opml.aspx?uid=2080&amp;amp;mid=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my feeds&lt;/a&gt; in to just 3 categories: Peoples blogs, High interest services, Low interest services. Things have gotten pretty smooth after establishing these categories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://shital.com/p/google-cheatsheet-and-clusty/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I know everything there is to know about Google searching, until&amp;hellip; I found there is an operator to search for synonyms and two words separated by a word and so on. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/help/cheatsheet.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Cheetsheet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that I&amp;rsquo;m often switching to &lt;a href=&#34;http://clusty.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clusty&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;ldquo;hard to find&amp;rdquo; things - usually when Googles first page of results is just irrelevant. I think clustering is inevitable technology for search engines and really hope Google speeds up their effort for implementation. It isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DVD-Audio Format</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/dvd-audio-format/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2004 21:32:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/dvd-audio-format/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/p/blue-man-group-and-polyphonic-spree/&#34;&gt;recent quest&lt;/a&gt; to find new music, I bumped in to brand new &lt;a href=&#34;http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid5_gci510035,00.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DVD-A format&lt;/a&gt; on which many &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/574074/102-8083421-0521740&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new demanding music albums&lt;/a&gt; are being delivered. It appears that this is definitely the next generation of music quality but there is very little or no information on many of its aspects. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize what I found so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This format is capable of delivering very high quality multi-channel surround sound on your home theater system. The DVD-A format is entirely different than usual &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/adbarr/page1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dolby Digital or DTS&lt;/a&gt; which is used for DVD movies. The quality that could be delivered using DVD-A is superior than Dolby Digital or DTS. If you look in to your DVD disk in Windows Explorer, you will find that there are two folders: Audio_TS and Video_TS. So far, only Video_TS folder was used to put all the movie files on DVDs because industry wasn&amp;rsquo;t settled on standards for DVD-A format. Recently standards have been finalized and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/574074&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;loads of new music albums&lt;/a&gt; are now being released in this format. They have content inside Audio_TS folder which contains DVD-A audio tracks in files with extension .aob. Because its brand new format, you need &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalaudioguide.com/dareview/players.htm#da%20(DVD-Audio)%20Players&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;newer DVD players&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.soundblaster.com/products/Audigy2ZS_platinum_pro/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sound cards&lt;/a&gt; to play it. However because most people aren&amp;rsquo;t going to upgrade their DVD players soon, these audio DVDs supply same sound tracks in Video_TS folder encoded in usual Dolby Digital or DTS which all players knows how to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now say you buy an audio album on DVD disc. Obviously you can&amp;rsquo;t play it on car stereo or your portable MP3 players because it’s a DVD disc rather than normal audio CD. Or you might want to take backup of your DVD-A disc as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/domorewith/sursoshowcase.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WMA Pro&lt;/a&gt; files on your PC whcih allows 7.1 surround sound and playback. So what you do? You need to convert DVD disc in to normal Audio disc or rip tracks to MP3s. Unfortunately this isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. The DVD-A format employs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1638228,00.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;higher level of encryption&lt;/a&gt; than usual DVDs. The DVD videos (stored in .vob files) employs copy protection scheme called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1638226,00.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; which can be broken in to very easily using DeCSS or even more friendly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dvddecrypter.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DVD Decryptor&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalaudioguide.com/faq/dvd-audio/faq_intro.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DVD-A format&lt;/a&gt; which was developed later has learned lesson from this hack and currently there is no known way to decrypt .aob files which contains DVD-A audio tacks. That means you can&amp;rsquo;t rip MP3s out of AOB files. Your only way out is to rip off from slightly lower quality Dolby/DTS formatted tracks. The most reliable and easy to use software to do this is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castudio.org/dvdaudioextractor/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DVD Audio Extractor&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately many DVD-A albums also provides &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.videohelp.com/forum/archive/t140530.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LPCM&lt;/a&gt; version of tracks along with AC3 (i.e. Dolby Digital)/DTS format. So to burn normal audio CDs or MP3s you might want to choose LPCM version. If DVD-A disc &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000051S65/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain LPCM tracks&lt;/a&gt;, than you are out of luck. The down-mix/demux process employed by most software to convert surround sound from AC3/DTS to plain stereo format doesn&amp;rsquo;t produce same quality as commercially available stereo tracks. Though you can try &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trevormarshall.com/byte_articles/byte7.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some equations&lt;/a&gt; to combine 5.1 channels in to stereo using SoftEncode etc and usually DTS works better than AC3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Continual Survival Of SharpReader</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/continual-survival-of-sharpreader/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sharpreader.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SharpReader&lt;/a&gt; to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/post-files/2004/09/sharpreader.zip&#34;&gt;my news (opml zip)&lt;/a&gt;. This is a small free app that has amazingly survived like an unevolving little insect in an environment where new species with more beef keeps coming. But this thing is still not extinct. I run around to look for an option with more features and end up at using SharpReader again and again. I&amp;rsquo;m though more interested that it dies away for one reason - the author isn&amp;rsquo;t publishing source code and at the same time he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to improve it by himself. It has pretty limited feature set but its designed so that its just barely enough to keep you alive. I tried to switch to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rssbandit.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RSS BandIt&lt;/a&gt; just to find that its fat feature list had missed some hearty points. Yesterday I looked at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Omega Reader&lt;/a&gt; and was very excited that finally this will call for an end of SharpReader - just to find that its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/features/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;super-fat features&lt;/a&gt; comes with same numbers of bugs. So I&amp;rsquo;m still continue to live with SharpReader virus. Its an example how to design your programs so that your users wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like it and at the same time can&amp;rsquo;t give it up.&lt;/p&gt;

Besides doing everything that you ever wanted from a thing called Task Manager (even showing open files for every process), it has one of the sweetest option that your application should provide: Replace Windows native [equivalent thing]! I just keep wishing if there had been free and with-source Calculators and Explorers and everything else Windows that I can just replace with a click like this and move on rather then &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2002/09/27.html#a1547&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;waiting for a decade&lt;/a&gt; on Microsoft to improve their &lt;a href=&#34;http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.windows.off-topic/5339&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;age old featureless&lt;/a&gt; apps. So when you are getting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stardock.com/products/windowblinds/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cool skinable Windows&lt;/a&gt;? In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1539735,00.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;next 3 years&lt;/a&gt;? Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NotepadX Preview Is Out!</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/notepadx-preview-is-out/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the thing I needed since like 3 years now and I started writing it by myself early 2003. But I knew something like this should have been already out there and I was probably wasting mytime in doing it all over again. So I decided to write several reusable application components rather then app itself and then build the app as a &amp;ldquo;demo&amp;rdquo; of components. I used NotepadX for about an year as a solo user while evolving and writing more code to make it better. And just now I felt it&amp;rsquo;s pretty sophisticated and stable enough for other people to preview it. For non-geeky users, NotepadX is a powerful utility to maintain their data. For programmers it&amp;rsquo;s lots of reusable interesting source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;obsolete&#34;&gt;
  Warning: This program was written circa 2003-2004 and last updated around Mar 26, 2004. It is currently considered obsolete. There are no plans to update it and no support is provided.

      <title>IE Most Wanted Tools</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/ie-sqaurefree-booklets/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2004 23:32:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/ie-sqaurefree-booklets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;these Internet Explorer &amp;ldquo;power tools&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;d wanted since soooo long. These little things called booklets are actually just shortcuts pointing to JavaScript which you can install by just drag and drop on your Links bar in IE (check View &amp;gt; Toolbars menu if you don&amp;rsquo;t see Links bar). If you want to save time from having browse through each of these things, you can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download my selection&lt;/a&gt; and extract them in to your Documents and Settings$$!Your_Login_name]\Favorites\Links folder and use them right away. You can do pretty neat things on a web page you are viewing once you have these little things. Some samples: View passwords, remove length limitations in a form, remove JavaScript, re-enable context menu, remove images and flashy stuff, show hidden fields in form, enable fields in form which are disabled, show borders of invisible tables, grayscale whole page (nice to have if page had weird colors), show HTTP headers, show HTML class when you roll over a block, force page wrap, lowercase everything, restore redirected links, view cookies, go to referer, sort table, number rows in table and more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cool Pocket PC Stuff</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/cool-pocket-pc-stuff/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2003 06:13:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/cool-pocket-pc-stuff/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you got this thingy and don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with it besides storing phone numbers and birthdays, well, here&amp;rsquo;s some &amp;ldquo;secrets&amp;rdquo; I came across after my first night with it 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pocketgear.com/software_detail.asp?id=3004&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sexual Positions 1.0&lt;/a&gt; - Of course, this has to be the first to grab :). No freaky stuff in this one and it&amp;rsquo;s legally free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pocketgear.com/software_detail.asp?id=3176&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pocket Bartender&lt;/a&gt; - It&amp;rsquo;s so convenient to handover your Pocket PC to bartender and ask her to make that drink that no one else has ever heard of!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bisque.com/Products/TheSkyPE/TheSkyPE.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TheSky Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt; - This is probably the best and most popular in it&amp;rsquo;s category. Think about coming out of your car, tap on your Pocket PC to see real-time sky map and know the name of that star you been wondering about in the middle of nowhere. If you had good telescope, you can even plug-in your pocket pc in to it and control it with pen taps! Other such programs include &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nomadelectronics.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pocket Stars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stellarmetrics.com/Software/pu2000.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pocket Universe&lt;/a&gt;. The bad thing about TheSky is that there is no trial edition available but I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that you can make a copy in someway if someone else has it. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask how!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://home.comcast.net/~jonsachs/#Ephemeris%201.0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ephemeris&lt;/a&gt; - This is cool little app to show moon phase, sun/moon rise times etc. Helpful if you were like me who won&amp;rsquo;t mind not sleeping additional one hour to see sun rise!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pdawin.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TV Remote Controller&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to make this work but the basic idea is that you are sitting in the bar and suddenly TV channel gets changed to Star Trek from some stupid sports game and no one knows how did that happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfcen.com/pocket/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Taiyoukei&lt;/a&gt; - This is nice set created by a Japanese guy for astronomy. Taiyoukei meaning &amp;ldquo;solar system&amp;rdquo;, for example, can tell you which planets are up in the sky right now among many other stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBooks - There are several free (the one on Kazza may not count) ebooks available which you can read on Pocket PC during your bus trips to New York. Special fun are kids books: Alice in the wonderland, Encarta Pocket Dictionary, Adventure of Tom Sawyer and Julius Verne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these cool stuff, Pocket PC as an operating system totally sucks. How one can even think of making it and selling it? There&amp;rsquo;s lots of scope here to make additions to this crappy operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yahoo! Launch Getting Better</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite online music service Rhapsody is not working for me these days. They &lt;em&gt;removed&lt;/em&gt; entire Linkin Park collection, few albums from Kid Rock and God knows what more. So I&amp;rsquo;m back to my old favorite Yahoo! Launch. They have gotten better with more selection, many more videos and more features. The best thing is, ofcourse, you can tell it what you liked and it will select more your kinda music rather then purely random songs. And it&amp;rsquo;s totally free! You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/lc/?rt=0&amp;amp;rp1=0&amp;amp;rp2=1214708279&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;listen to my own customized radio station&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;m listening to right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual Worlds With POV-Ray</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/virtual-worlds-with-pov-ray-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2003 04:14:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/virtual-worlds-with-pov-ray-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2003/06/testground.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2003/06/testground-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;testground&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-1099&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/testground-300x225.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/testground.jpg 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.povray.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;POV-Ray&lt;/a&gt; is the 3D graphic software which allows you to create 3D world with lightings, reflections, shadows, color gradients, materials, textures and so on. I&amp;rsquo;d read about it about 5 years ago and almost ignored it - until just few days back I decided to gave it a whirl one more time (I think it was a sudden urge to create some 3D graphics). Just after a quick simple installation and spending 15 minutes on beginner&amp;rsquo;s tutorial, I was totally in to it. Just a couple of hours more and I&amp;rsquo;d &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2003/06/testground.jpg&#34;&gt;my very first 3D image which is cool enough to show off&lt;/a&gt;. By the time night fall, I already had an AVI movie with a virtual walkthrough in my 3D world (by making camera move along a specified trajectory). This thing is addictive and it rocks. I can now calculate 3D coordinates and linear transformations in my head! The scripting language it uses is C like and very intuitive. Sure there were many other ray tracing programs including 3D Studio but this open source free program is much more &amp;ldquo;programmer oriented&amp;rdquo; rather then &amp;ldquo;artist oriented&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irtc.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Internet Ray Tracing Competition&lt;/a&gt; for some truly mind blowing virtual images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/PlayingWithPovRay&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Source code for my above first image is now at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Better Giving</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/the-better-giving-for-relatives-abroad-2002/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2002 07:09:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/the-better-giving-for-relatives-abroad-2002/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A year ago it took me around 6 months before I felt it was the perfect gift to give it to my cousins. But the trouble was that by the time they received it they got confused whether it was for last year&amp;rsquo;s occasion or coming year&amp;rsquo;s! It&amp;rsquo;s an art to find a gift that&amp;rsquo;s unique, hard to find, memorable and the one matching with person&amp;rsquo;s personality and need. Here are some of those tips and places that I came across over time to help you out this holiday season. 1. The premier destination to get the unique gift idea is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.surprise.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;surprise.com&lt;/a&gt;. A must visit if you are still in the complete darkness. 2. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my collection of gift links&lt;/a&gt;. You will find things ranging from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drugstore.com/qxp69153_333181_sespider/kama_sutra/weekender_kit.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kamasutra weekender kit&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://stardate.utexas.edu/giftshop/store.tpl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Astronomy&amp;rsquo;s cool gift ideas&lt;/a&gt;. 3. To find out what&amp;rsquo;s latest and coolest, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?&amp;amp;articleID=00062C10-684A-1DDE-A838809EC588F2D7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scientific American&amp;rsquo;s Top SciTech Gifts of 2002&lt;/a&gt;. This one is a real good contemporary compilation. 4. If you still didn&amp;rsquo;t found you were looking for, view &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my collection of shopping links&lt;/a&gt;. Specially check for Diversity Stores section. 5. Instead of giving gifts to someone who already has too much, you might want to ask them if it&amp;rsquo;s ok to give some donations to non-profit organizations instead of giving them yet another gift that would be anyway useless to them. Click here for some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;charity organizations in my links collection&lt;/a&gt;. 6. Finally here are my personal favorites and non-favorites for this year: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wizcomtech.com/products2/quicktionary2.php3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Quicktionary&lt;/a&gt;, Book light (both are perfect if a person is an avid reader), external hard drive (perfect for heavy laptop users because they always run out of space), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getfeetwet.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;handheld GPS&lt;/a&gt; (for outdoor person), &lt;a href=&#34;http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/default.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lego Mindstorm robot kit&lt;/a&gt; (absolute perfect gift for kids), DVD/MP3 players, HP49 calc (perfect for mathematicians), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ehobbies.com/radio-control-airplanes.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;model air plane kit&lt;/a&gt; (prefer unassembled ones). And now the things that sucks as gifts: fragrances, cloths, pocket PCs and palms, organizers, CD players, pocket MP3 players, RC cars, PS2. These gifts totally suck. Finally it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to go overboard. Infect being a follower of &amp;lsquo;Grinch philosophy&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to hate all give and take of gifts. May be it&amp;rsquo;s just enough to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;send a web card&lt;/a&gt; with few clicks to let someone know that you still remember.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Get To Sleep Faster</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/how-to-get-to-sleep-faster/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2002 06:40:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/how-to-get-to-sleep-faster/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not submitting ourselves to sleep is a problem for many of us. Here&amp;rsquo;s few of the ideas that I found works getting little closer to your dreams 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thing that almost always worked for me is to read real complex book filled with poorly proven math equations and undecipherable physics text (or some translated ones). It quickly drains out all extra energies and puts you in nice sleep (no pun intended)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on your air conditioner. The heat won&amp;rsquo;t let you die. The colder environment slows down body functions, helps to dry down the energy levels and drives you towards the kind of &amp;ldquo;stasis&amp;rdquo;. Note that you should never sleep without warm comforter/duvets in this case (even if this looks contradictory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new recent find that has also worked well: drink glass of warm milk before going to sleep! Well, actually it&amp;rsquo;s from all-wise &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.startrek.com/library/individ.asp?ID=112466&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Guineen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s character in Star Trek TNG. No wonder it works 🙂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last one is to put on the run of classical music on very low volume. It isn&amp;rsquo;t very effective but it&amp;rsquo;s cool!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How To Blog</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/how-to-blog-on-blogger-com-2002/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2002 04:34:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/how-to-blog-on-blogger-com-2002/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just finished making this blog page! Wow. It took exactly 5 hours. When I started, I was going to program this whole stuff by myself and almost on the verge of firing VS.Net. And then I saw this site Blogger.com. As per the 10 commandments of programming world, never spend time in writing programs which has been already done and which are reusable. And this site was great. I created a template so that user will see blogs as integral part of my site. No fuzz. Though I&amp;rsquo;d to pay $15 to remove ads. Other complains include lack of ability to post comments and no built in search engine. But otherwise, I nearly saved atleast 3 days worth of coding. I really wonder why I&amp;rsquo;ve started so late&amp;hellip; so many good things will now remain un-blogged&amp;hellip; lol.&lt;/p&gt;
