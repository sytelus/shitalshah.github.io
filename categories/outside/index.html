      There is no substitute to reading official Survival Guide but it does leaves out many things. So instead of writing my detailed trip report I thought about all the mistakes I’d made and converting them to tips. Here it goes…
 Sun shelter (things that look like REI Alcove) is absolutely essential if you just have a camping tent. I would however not recommend REI Alcove itself because it broke after withstanding 3 days of sandstorms.

Fortunately there is a website (although not that good) called MotionBased which can slice and dice and analyze this track data and tell you lot of cool things.
Here&rsquo;s the MotionBased&rsquo;s analysis of Snoqualmie Falls hike.

      I LOVE slot canyons and Zion Narrows hike is something on my To-do for very long time since I saw it in a documentary and IMAX. So when I saw this deal from Southwest about 50% off on all travels my first thought was to book tickets to Las Vegas (nearest to Zion) or SLC. Due to restriction on this deal the travel needs to be completed by May 31st.

      Today I tried Mount Si hike again and returned back before I saw &ldquo;Snag Flats&rdquo;, second time. Snag Flats are supposed to somewhere between 1300&rsquo; to 1500&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s relatively small hike that you can do in 2-3 hours (full hike to summit of Mount Si is a long 8 hour 3200&rsquo; climb). Today because of heavily packed wet snow it was extremely slippery. Many people even had crampons on. People who did not had any traction devices (like me) had very hard time to go up on slippery trail and even harder time to come down.

I guess&nbsp;early March&nbsp;is among the best time to visit Alaska (thanks to my wife for figuring out fantastic itinerary)&nbsp;because you are still just in time to catch views of&nbsp;Aurora Boriales and there is so much festivities going on.&nbsp;We had our Yup&rsquo;ik wedding ceremony at the Ice Hotel at Chena Hotsprings&nbsp;which is a hotel made of only ice with colorful lights shining through. Taking a dip in natural hot&nbsp;sulfur rich springs in below freezing temperatures with Aurora Borealis&nbsp;passing over head&nbsp;could certainly bring you one of the most memorable times even if its not your wedding ceremony&nbsp;night ;).

On US east coast, Maine and an odd little dot in the heart of Adirondacks are two places where the amazing fall colors appears first.

      It&rsquo;s cool to be in mountains when fall is just still arriving and you are among the first to feel it. This year my First Of Autumn hikes happened in Adirondacks. This area in upper state New York is probably among the most scenic part on East Coast. You got choice of 46 high peaks to climb (a High Peak is a mountain taller then 4000 ft) apart from countless small mountains and hills, several small and huge lakes to canoe and kayak or just relax on cruise, quite a few waterfalls and quint towns.

      I&rsquo;ve some more time and it&rsquo;s my first day doing blogs so I&rsquo;ll put down few more tid bits&hellip; This one is about fall foliage travelling I did this year. Last year I went out to 3 day trip to New Hampshire and drove through much of the state. This year I decided to went down North-east Pennsylvania. The driving route at Bucktail State Park was listed as &lsquo;one of the most beautiful spot to be&rsquo; in foliage by Yahoo Travel newsletter.
