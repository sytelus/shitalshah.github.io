      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that you have lived so many years, each having so many days, there&amp;rsquo;s question: How many times you have stood up, raised your head, seen the stars and felt nothing? Well, think twice. You&amp;rsquo;d just popped up your head out of your small tiny ridiculously insignificant world in to something that&amp;rsquo;s stunningly vast and breathtakingly beautiful. Astronomy has been a favorite passion for few of the us fortunate beings since ages and the lesser beings now need not left behind.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flying is nearly every human&amp;rsquo;s dream and unstoppable desire. And now it&amp;rsquo;s possible to get enroll in to private pilot licence program, stay in a budget ($120/lesson without discounts) and see how the world looks from the eyes of the clouds! If you are a &lt;a href=&#34;www.startrek.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Star-Trek&lt;/a&gt; fan, you already know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. So get your feet off the ground and prepare to give that baby a little spin! Check out for the small airports around your area where you can almost usually find a flight training schools which may allow you to take a test or just walk-in lesson. And don&amp;rsquo;t worry. You will be putting your hands on very small planes like Cessna 152 which is fun to fly but you can&amp;rsquo;t really hurt anybody, ofcourse except yourself :-).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For most people, it&amp;rsquo;s not too hard to get bored of going popular, famous, major-attraction kind of places. In that case, may be we share the same blood of explorers. Since last many months I&amp;rsquo;m scouting for the places which are unknown, least populated, beautiful and lonely. In heavily populated states like New Jersey it&amp;rsquo;s tough. Start by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.topozone.com/&#34; title=&#34;Topographically important sites&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TopoZone&lt;/a&gt; - a site which tells you where&amp;rsquo;s all those mountains, lakes, cliffs, falls, forests, valleys and even lava flows are! Buy a GPS (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003OPEV/qid=1018246835/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_67_1/104-6492949-7167901&#34; title=&#34;Amazon.com listing for emap GPS&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Garmin&amp;rsquo;s e-map&lt;/a&gt; is a good one) and software Topo maps to take you there. If you are living in New Jersey, check out these &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wildnj.com/njm5main.htm&#34; title=&#34;10 most beautiful places&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;10 Most Beautiful Places&lt;/a&gt; to visit. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to put up a writeup on good places to hike in NJ/NY/CN/PN before summer ends and as I get time but if you need that info right away &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/contact/&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spring is here and so the refreshing blooms! Take a closer look to nature&amp;rsquo;s refreshing beauty by knowing the trees better. Can you identify at least 5 tress you will meet on the roads? Which tree doesn&amp;rsquo;t loose their leaves in fall? Is male and female flowers separate for this one? That&amp;rsquo;s just few questions you might. Get the pocket book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/158238133X/qid=1018245256/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-6492949-7167901&#34; title=&#34;Books on trees&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trees : A Guide to Familiar American Trees&lt;/a&gt; . If you are leaving neat New York city, visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centralpark.org/&#34; title=&#34;NYC&#39;s Central Park&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt; - An ultra cool place for hang out. If you live somewhere else, search for the botanical gardens in your area or move on to road trips to state parks. Also check out the books on identifying flowers at &lt;a href=&#34;http://amazon.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those strange music notations always made me curious. How is it possible &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; the music? Will I ever be able to read these notations and play a piece? Can I jot down the notes of GNR&amp;rsquo;s Sweet Child Of Mine while I hear it? I read that some of the masters never really played few of their creations - it was all in their minds and then in to paper! Check out the books to get you started: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764551051/qid=1018245869/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_7_1/104-6492949-7167901&#34; title=&#34;Amazon.com listing for Piano For Dummies&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Piano For Dummies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/097075129X/qid=1018246096/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-6492949-7167901&#34; title=&#34;Amazon.com listing for the book&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Basic Music Theory : How to Read, Write, and Understand Written Music&lt;/a&gt;{.ActiveClass}&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Think AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate to say this, but this one is for computer programmers and that too who comes in geeky hardcore diehard flavors with a love for mathematics. If you are running out of quality challenges and you have started thinking that programming is as trivial as bank clerk&amp;rsquo;s job, here&amp;rsquo;s something you can face. As a programmer, Artificial Intelligence is the biggest, best and most worthwhile challenge ever to take upon! But what AI really means? where do I start? Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a-i.com/&#34; title=&#34;A-i.com&#39;s learning Machine Challange&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learning Machine Challenge&lt;/a&gt; - an open challenge to whole world with crystal clear definition of what needs to be achieved from programmer&amp;rsquo;s point of view. You can also find &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/LandP101&#34; title=&#34;My LearnAndPlay program submitted for www.a-i.com&#39;s Learning Machine Challange&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my submission&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.a-i.com&#34; title=&#34;Company who organized The Learning Machine Challange&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a-i.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Learning Machine Challenge. It&amp;rsquo;s probably first ever &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; program written in C# with capability to learn rules of any game while you play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
