      Introduction There are two files that contains all stories and comments posted at Hacker News from its start in 2006 to May 29, 2014 (exact dates are below). This was downloaded using simple program available I wrote Hacker News Downloader by making REST API calls to HN&rsquo;s official APIs. The program used API parameters to paginate through created date of items to retrieve all posts and comments. The file contains entire sequence of JSON responses exactly as returned by API call in JSON array.

      Past weekend, I finally thought about giving Twitter a try and started looking for a client app that just allows me to very quickly update the status with a global keyboard shot cut. I&rsquo;m not in to following anyone or replying anyone but wanted this very simple app with one text box. Apparently no such apps existed in Twitter Fan Wiki which actually turned out to be a good thing because I immediately started looking at Twitter&rsquo;s API and any C# wrappers.

      There are tons and tons of things to blog but here is a quick one.
Last Thanksgiving (a 4 days of holidays in USA) I wanted to work on something really cool that is absolutely worth doing and something I can spend my entire 4 days continuosly. I looked over my list of pending projects to find something extraordinarily cool, kept thinking about new ideas flowing around, looked over to other idea websites and realized that my mind was just keept going blank all the while.

      About a year and half ago, the new version of Groove had came out and it still didn&rsquo;t had an ability export IMs. It drove me nuts so I started to write my own Groove tool that would do it in excuse to explore its infamous internals. Ah! What a ride that was! Groove APIs have extremely huge surface area (which means there are thousands and thousands of them sprinkled all over in hard to find places).

Operator overloading should never be the only way to use the functionality if your code targets 1.x versions of frameworks because VB.Net can&rsquo;t access it without resorting to ugly calls such as op_Addition

One day we decide to call up with each other on phone (only 2 people on one line), talk to each other and have our lists sync&rsquo;ed up with each other.

      Groove is perhaps one of the finest example of technology in recent times which has tons of potential and no vision. If you ask Groove what their product is, they will probably reply with something like this: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a program that allows people to work together on files, projects, meetings and so on.&ldquo;. And that underlines their severe lack of vision and plain immaturity which otherwise could have changed the face of the Internet.

I strongly feel that this is the most important work in the field which is otherwise so bloated with wasted directionless efforts. This book is nothing like any research paper you might have read so far. It&rsquo;s written in very personal way. Instead of just spitting out end product, thoughts and algorithms, author also tells you what other directions he was thinking about and what made him to go for this one.

      This program demos two very interesting algorithms that I&rsquo;d started designing during Fall 2004 and then got busy in other stuff.
First algorithm is simple which I call List Extractor and it finds the list like structures in any given text and extracts the data out of them. This enables automatic data extraction without prior knowledge of layout or formatting in web pages. If you look at lot of web pages, you will find that they just present some data in some repetative HTML formatting which I call a &ldquo;list&rdquo;.

      Omar blogs about an age-old debate on whether class members should be virtual-by-default or final-by-default. Here&rsquo;s my take:
After my years of messing around with .Net class libraries, I would prefer virtual-by-default any day. Basically, when people designs their classes they really don&rsquo;t want to spend much time on analyzing how someone else would be overriding a particular method - unless they are really sure that lot of people really wants to do that.

And that&rsquo;s besides having cool Dundas Chart control and tons of other components from Component One absolutely free (though their charting component is pretty miserable and requires free registration for licensing). Charting is seriously missing component in 2.0&rsquo;s toolbox.and I&rsquo;m just wondering why doesn&rsquo;t MS thinks of bundling these components with VS.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      I don&rsquo;t know how no one is bothered by this. May be because it affects Longhorn. But anyway, everybody would agree that while .Net solved the DLL Hell issue, it created its own which I affectionally call Assembly Hell and had my rants loud from the start. I&rsquo;d high hopes when I heard Jeff Richter is on the team. But be hold, they come up with the statement that the problem is &ldquo;mathematically&rdquo; unsolvable and some fuzzy argument to back up that statement and then they reveal possibly the worst versioning scheme I&rsquo;ve heard in a decade for anything: divide the assemblies in &ldquo;platform&rdquo; and &ldquo;library&rdquo; groups!

      This is collection of several reusable components to use in your WinForms application. I&rsquo;d been building it up and reusing in my own personal applications such as BrowserHistoryAnalyser and NotepadX and others. It contains editable drag-n-drop enabled TreeView, RichText editor control with toolbar, Worksheet editor control, Password Input Form, MRU, custom attributes you can use for your assemblies, more easily usable hidden property editor control, advanced About Dialog, Application Options management and Assembly Info Viewer Control.
