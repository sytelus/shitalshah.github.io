&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two files that contains all stories and comments posted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; from its start in 2006 to May 29, 2014 (exact dates are below). This was downloaded using simple program available I wrote  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News Downloader&lt;/a&gt; by making REST API calls to &lt;a href=&#34;https://hn.algolia.com/api&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HN&amp;rsquo;s official APIs&lt;/a&gt;. The program used API parameters to paginate through created date of items to retrieve all posts and comments. The file contains entire sequence of JSON responses exactly as returned by API call in JSON array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hnstoriesall-json&#34;&gt;HNStoriesAll.json&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contains all the stories posted on HN from &lt;code&gt;Mon, 09 Oct 2006 18:21:51 GMT&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Thu, 29 May 2014 08:25:40 GMT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-count&#34;&gt;Total count&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1,333,789&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;file-size&#34;&gt;File size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2GB uncompressed, 115MB compressed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-was-this-created&#34;&gt;How was this created&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a small program &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News Downloader&lt;/a&gt; to create these files, available at Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;format&#34;&gt;Format&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entire file is JSON compliant array. Each element in array is json object that is exactly the response that returned by HN Algolia REST API. The property named `hits` contains the actual list of stories. As this file is very large we recommend json parsers that can work on file streams instead of reading entire data in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-to-download&#34;&gt;Where to download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As GitHub restricts each file to be only 100MB and also has policies against data ware housing, these files are currently hosted at FileDropper.com. Unfortunately FileDropper currently shows ads with misleading download link so be careful on what link you click. Below is the screenshot FileDropper shows and currently the button marked in red would download the actual file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;few-points-of-interests&#34;&gt;Few points of interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API rate limit is 10,000 requests per hour or you get blacklisted. I tried to be even more conservative by putting 4 sec of sleep between calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to keep entire response from the call as-is. So return value of this function is used to stream a serialized array of JSON response objects to a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the output files are giant JSON files, you will need a JSON parser that can use streams. I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://james.newtonking.com/json&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JSON.NET&lt;/a&gt; which worked out pretty well. You can find the sample code in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In total 1.3M stories and 5.8M comments were downloaded and each took about ~10 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see all of HN stories and comments so far fits in to under just 1GB compressed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-and-suggestions&#34;&gt;Issues and Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know any issues and suggestions in comments. You can also file issue at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsData&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; Github repo&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d created for this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past weekend, I finally thought about giving Twitter a try and started looking for a client app that just allows me to very quickly update the status with a global keyboard shot cut. I&amp;rsquo;m not in to following anyone or replying anyone but wanted this very simple app with one text box. Apparently no such apps existed in Twitter Fan Wiki which actually turned out to be a good thing because I immediately started looking at Twitter&amp;rsquo;s API and any C# wrappers. About 90 minutes later I&amp;rsquo;d my app ready. On the way I also added functionality to break the big updates in to multiple twits. This little (literally) app is now open sourced on CodePlex and ready for you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeplex.com/QckTwit/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;try it out&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These two small utilities I&amp;rsquo;d wrote about an year ago and since then they were sitting on my network share. Meanwhile lot of people in my team used it and found them useful. There is still a large list of features that I&amp;rsquo;d like to add but even without it, these are pretty usable at this point. So enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing DSS</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/introducing-dss/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:04:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/introducing-dss/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are tons and tons of things to blog but here is a quick one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thanksgiving (a 4 days of holidays in USA) I wanted to work on something really cool that is absolutely worth doing and something I can spend my entire 4 days continuosly. I looked over my list of pending projects to find something extraordinarily cool, kept thinking about new ideas flowing around, looked over to other idea websites and realized that my mind was just keept going blank all the while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when people asked what were my plans for thanksgiving, I&amp;rsquo;d reply &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing Project Blank&amp;rdquo; :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just so happened, at the very start of the thanksgiving I was casualy reading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSE specs&lt;/a&gt; that was just announced by Ray Ozzie and immediately realized things missing in there and the huge possibilities of massive human collaboration that it can make happen. Rest of it is the story. I ended up spending about 16 hours a day in designing what I call now Data Syndication Services specifications and writing a reference application for it. While my efforts were inspired by SSE and Groove, the DSS design enables data sharing on a massive scale on much realistic grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what, I still call the project binaries Blank :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to take a look? Go ahead and collaborate &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/dss&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on my GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Groove Hacks</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/groove-hacks/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2005 05:48:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/groove-hacks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year and half ago, the new version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/astrila/messageexport/&#34;&gt;Groove&lt;/a&gt; had came out and it still didn&amp;rsquo;t had an ability export IMs. It drove me nuts so I started to write my own Groove tool that would do it in excuse to explore its infamous internals. Ah! What a ride that was! Groove APIs have extremely huge surface area (which means there are thousands and thousands of them sprinkled all over in hard to find places). Tons of them have confusing names, misleading functionalities and put in the wrong place. The fun part? There is almost no documentation! And yeah, did I forgot to mention that they are heavy C++ oriented, frequently late bound and mostly proprietary stuff (they even have their own proprietary definition for rich text and APIs!)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your brain needs some challenge that&amp;rsquo;s the place to dig in to. After sacrificing my 3 weekends I finally had a working tool that exports Groove IMs and put them to Outlook without loosing formatting or attachments! I consider this an equivalent feat of removing nag dialog of WinZip by changing a x86 jump instruction in its disassembled binary using only Visual Studio debugger and absolutely nothing else ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool had been sitting on my hard drive crying to get out for months and months. In between, I did some polishing up, adding wizards, support for Word and Excel, creating a help file and even created a website for it. So now I think it’s pretty much ready and have decided to give it away for free personal use (similar tools cost $50 something I guess). &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/astrila/messageexport/&#34;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt; if you use Groove and want to save your invaluable messages! Call it laziness or ignorance or whatever but I really do feel guilty not to putting this out early when 3.0 came out and lot of people SO need it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11406/Enable-Your-Users-to-Write-Math-Equations-in-Your&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my new article on CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;. The mission on MimeTeX was started about couple of months ago when in a weekend I just got attracted to MimeTeX&amp;rsquo;s C code like a magnet ;). Now I&amp;rsquo;ve built ASP.Net handler, caching, admin etc on the top of it and its looking great! Enabling scientific content on web seems to be my new obsession. So if you take pride in delighting your users with every new release, here&amp;rsquo;s your brand new feature! Go ahead, download it, use it! If you run in to any problem, I&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to offer you my help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Cool .Net Nuggets</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/some-cool-net-nuggets/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2005 22:00:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/some-cool-net-nuggets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If type&amp;rsquo;s constructor (i.e. static constructor) throws an exception, entire type becomes unusable. Any attempt to call any member of that type would result in TypeInitializationException.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operator overloading should never be the only way to use the functionality if your code targets 1.x versions of frameworks because VB.Net can&amp;rsquo;t access it without resorting to ugly calls such as &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;op_Addition&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is universal symbol for money (a generic version of $, £, ¥ etc) and it&amp;rsquo;s ¤ (U+00A4). If you format the number as currency in culture invariant way then .net attaches this symbol to your number. I just think it&amp;rsquo;s cool to have some universal symbol for money :).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplest way to convert hex number to int: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Int32.Parse(&amp;ldquo;1AFF&amp;rdquo;, NumberStyles.HexNumber, null)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplest way to display array of bytes as hex values: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;BitConverter.ToString(byteArray)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you updated something in your computer and suddenly your .Net app behaves bad, it is possible to do automatic rollback.. The .Net Framework keeps track of assemblies that was loaded by any managed app up. This info is stored in an INI file in &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;LocalSettings\Application Data\ApplicationHistory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and is used by .Net Application Restore tool. I think this great debugging aid too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In .Net world, zombies are not purely an imagination: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Person
{
static object HoldOnToMe;
~Person()
{
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;HoldOnToMe = this;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
    GC.ReRegisterForFinalize(this);
}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Values types are allocated on stack but not when you have an array of value types. For example, &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;new Int32[100]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;allocates 100 unboxed integers on heap, not on stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finally block is not really always guaranteed to get executed. If any of these 3 special exceptions do happen, code in Finally won&amp;rsquo;t be executed: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OutOfMemoryException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;StackOverFlowException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExecutionEngineException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;d be fortunate enough to experience all of these). That means you had created some global kernel objects, they will indeed hang around and may interfere when user restarts your app. BTW, if you see a code like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;catch(Exception ex) {...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;catch{...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;, tell the developer that he has committed a sin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently GC.Collect() is not always a line of code you should disgust at. You might want to do it especially when you &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; the process and had created loads of objects which won&amp;rsquo;t be used any further (for example moving on to a new tab in WinForms app). I used this in one of my projects to improve on the memory pressure and was really feeling guilty about it, until recently. &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;        GC.Collect();
//block my thread till objects needing finalization are done
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
GC.Collect();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should always strong name your assemblies, especially if it is going to be used by assemblies in multiple AppDomains in the same process because only they are shared between domains; otherwise each AppDomain will have it&amp;rsquo;s own copy. Why anyone would have multiple AppDomains, you ask. Well, if you are enabling your app to have 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party plugins, I strongly recommend loading all these plugins in to a separate domain. This way not only you can control the security policy on these plugins but also unload the bad plugins without shutting down your app. This is often overlooked in various plugin architectures for .Net but if you don&amp;rsquo;t do this, you app might go on the same route as IE6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have enabled your app or website for localization, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to test it with Turkish language. If your thread is having CurrentCulture Turkish (tr-TR) and if you try to uppercase a letter i, you get 0 instead of normal english I (i.e. Unicode character U+0130 instead of U+0049). Scott Hanselman has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UpdateOnTheDasBlogTurkishIBugAndAReminderToMeOnGlobalization.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a first hand experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you know Application.ThreadException event which lets you capture the unhandled exceptions in WinForms app and do something like Windows Error Reporting. But the better way is probably &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AppDomain.UnhandledException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;event because that also lets you get notified for non-CLS compliant exceptions and without needing a reference to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                    

&lt;p&gt;object.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The values of public constants that you reference from other assemblies are embedded in your own assembly metadata. That means, if other assembly changes the value of the constant afterwards, you must recompile your own assembly or otherwise you still will be using that old value of the constant. I think this is as critical &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/27597&#34; title=&#34;My post on OT list about how troublesome this problem could be&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lapsed event handlers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jagged arrays are not CLS compliant. If you are building a library that can be used by VB or C# guys, you can&amp;rsquo;t have jagged arrays as public member type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Basic can do this: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Try
&amp;hellip;
Catch e as Exception &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;When x = 0&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
&amp;hellip;
End try
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of wrapping calendar information in to the RSS feed may sound very appealing. Almost every website owned by some kind of group or organization has their event calendar. The thought that you can aggregate them in to your &amp;ldquo;Calendar Aggregator&amp;rdquo; is just so geekily cool. What if people started putting up their weekend plans through some kind of RSS-Calendar and you can subscribe to them in your calendar program! I dig through dozens of W3C and other specs and half a dozen of implementation to find out what has been done so far and why it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet. The result of my findings and possible solution are summarized in &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/p/integrating-rss-and-calendar/&#34;&gt;my essay&lt;/a&gt; in some reader friendly writing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would be writing all New York City related stuff at &lt;a href=&#34;http://nyc.metblogs.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Metblogs&lt;/a&gt; rather then my own blog. This makes sense because lot of people who aren&amp;rsquo;t in this region doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to get those NYC stories. On the other hand, my NYC related writing will now reach to much larger audience. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=site:nyc.metblogs.com+%22shital+shah%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;c2coff=1&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;filter=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some of my entries there&lt;/a&gt; about cool New York events, restaurants and such stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other site news, you might have noticed new skin and more FireFox friendly design. I also decided to give away the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/SyFastPage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;engine that my website runs on&lt;/a&gt; (C# code I wrote almost 4 years ago) along with entire &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/ShitalShahWebV3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source code for this website&lt;/a&gt; (thats in VB.Net just for fun). Nothing special but main highlights of the engine is that it accepts raw HTML file as the base template and embeds your dynamic ASP.Net WebForm content inside that HTML. It also provides navigation control which runs off of XHTML templates and XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like my free utilities, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/p/category/software/&#34;&gt;massive updates in my Software section&lt;/a&gt;. It has now many more of my programs and utilities that I kept it to myself. Specifically, the one called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/BrowserHistoryAnalyzer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Browser History Analyzer&lt;/a&gt; analyses your IE history (support for FireFox coming soon), builds MS Access database and gives you tons of amusing info about your browsing habits such has the queries you fired on search engine, how do you refine your keywords progressively, how much time you usually spend on a page, how much time you spend on browsing and so on. Whilte still in development, it also features extensible architecture to let you make your own plugins. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put the link for article I wrote for CodeProject about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/WinProgressDialog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how to show Explorer&amp;rsquo;s progress dialog in your apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally some &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/photos/111712720654017421562/albums/5987178406068558081&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alaska trip photos&lt;/a&gt; also have been added. Yenjoy :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Truly Managed Operating Systems</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/on-truly-managed-operating-systems/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2005 19:03:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/on-truly-managed-operating-systems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who have worked with .Net or Java would have certainly thought about this: Is there a way to extend these runtimes/VMs to build truly managed operating system? As it turns out Longhorn would be &amp;ldquo;mostly&amp;rdquo; managed OS but this is not the kind of &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo; OS stuff we are talking about. We are talking about truly managed OS, in theory and in imagination, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at .Net runtime, it indeed provides several services that should be coming from OS otherwise: threading, security, PE loading and so on. When I was watching the documentary &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308808/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Stallman was describing similar situation in his days: they wanted to build an OS, they had compilers, all kind of command line utilities, code for various services and so on but they were missing a kernel. So even if they had got lot of functionality working, they still needed some base OS to run off their stuff. I think the .Net runtime/JVM are in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what a managed OS would look like? Who handles all the system calls down the line and how? Say I want to turn on a pixel on the screen, what my lowest level code running on a truly managed OS would look like? Let’s think about it: the lowest level managed code you can write in .Net is IL, which is essentially an assembly language for a virtualized CPU and memory system. The IL essentially has no idea about the world outside its virtualized CPU and memory system. For instance, I can’t write any direct IL instructions to read sector 510 from my hard drive or turn on a pixel on my screen. In its current form, I would have no choice but to extend IL somehow so I can make low level system BIOS calls or embed native instruction for my graphic card inside my IL. That’s not good. If I’m allowed to embed such low level calls in IL, the whole thing isn’t &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo; anymore and also not independent of the hardware I’m using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I thought about this more, I converged to the answer that we need a &amp;ldquo;runtime&amp;rdquo; for each of the subsystem in the computer. If you think about it, a hard-drive controller is a CPU in its own right with its own instruction set and so is your graphics card. Your main CPU and memory are just &amp;ldquo;over hyped&amp;rdquo; subsystems of your computer. Our traditional runtime and IL only virtualizes main CPU and memory, not these other subsystems. Once we have this &amp;ldquo;runtime&amp;rdquo; for video subsystem, hard drive controller and so on, it should be possible to write pure IL instructions to say, draw a bitmap on the screen. Notice that the IL code should work on any graphics card which has been similarly virtualized. Now you see, these &amp;ldquo;runtimes&amp;rdquo; for subsystems are essentially equivalent to drivers in current world but with a twist that they follow exactly the same structure and standards as the main runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now imagination can go wild: You have several &amp;ldquo;runtimes&amp;rdquo; running and managing each subsystem in your computer. Obviously each of these runtimes needs to discover and talk with other. The traditional runtime only manages main processor and memory but now it needs to send out IL instructions to say, VM controlling hard drive. So we now have a need for a standard protocol to discover virtual machines in the system and talk to them (much like Plug And Play). Also we need a system boot-strapper, which initializes all the runtimes in your system and provides common &amp;ldquo;channel&amp;rdquo; for them to discover and talk with each other. I also speculate a base runtime from which all other runtimes must &amp;ldquo;inherit&amp;rdquo; so as to enforce common infrastructure such as secured access to instructions and inter-VM communication. If you let your imagination wilder, you can think of a runtime/VM as something that consumes bytecode, changes its own memory state and outputs bytecode to another VM or a hardware. So essentially you can have cascading VMs too. You can even pass objects around VMs and even create your own VM (for example, to emulate non-existent hardware or to create a OS level service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the managed OS again? It’s collection of VMs for each subsystem and a bootstrapper. Good, we got somewhere. Anything you code against it would be (really) 100% pure managed code with potential to be executed on variety of hardware. Infect you could even have a VM which simply delegates call to parent OS instead of real hardware subsystem. That could make it possible to build versions of this managed OS that could run off the host OS that you already have, without forcing you to partition your hard drive or reboot your machine. This would still let all your &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo; code run as is it but may be without extra-strength security and such stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds really cool. Now only if I can figure out how performance won&amp;rsquo;t suck&amp;hellip; 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Algorithm Puzzle - Sync&#39;ing Big Lists And Nodes</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/algorithm-puzzle-syncing-big-lists-and-nodes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2005 01:05:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/algorithm-puzzle-syncing-big-lists-and-nodes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a mathematical algorithmic puzzle for all you bright challange-seeking minds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve my own big business contact list and so does my friends. One day we decide to call up with each other on phone (only 2 people on one line), talk to each other and have our lists sync&amp;rsquo;ed up with each other. That is to say, we add any contacts we didn&amp;rsquo;t had already, update any outdated ones and delete anyone who has gone out of business. However, you will be pleased to know that content of any two contact lists are pretty much same with only few differences. Infect many of my friends have identical contact lists and so they don&amp;rsquo;t need sync&amp;rsquo;ing at all (though they don&amp;rsquo;t know if they do have identical lists). We&amp;rsquo;ll let you arrange pairs of people calling each other any way and at any time you&amp;rsquo;d like. Eventually, we hope to end up with exactly identical one mega list. But we want you to be fair, i.e., schemes like appointing one &amp;ldquo;central person&amp;rdquo; and having everyone talk to him in turns and let him do all the sync work is not cool. That&amp;rsquo;s not fair for him and that would take lot of time too because talking in turns uses only one phone line at a time. For us &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; means each person only needs to talk with same number of people as every other person needs to. And yes, before I forget to mention, our contact lists are really big and so does the count of my friends - both currently running over a million - and of course, us busy tired souls want you to finish this exercise in as little time and effort as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how would you do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE: I&amp;rsquo;d posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/38726&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the answer in the off topic group&lt;/a&gt;. Excerpt is in comments. Enjoy!]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applications And Platforms, An Another Face Of Internet And Why I Hate Groove</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/applications-and-platforms-an-another-face-of-internet-and-why-i-hate-groove/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2005 02:11:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/applications-and-platforms-an-another-face-of-internet-and-why-i-hate-groove/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.Groove.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groove&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps one of the finest example of technology in recent times which has tons of potential and no vision. If you ask Groove what their product is, they will probably reply with something like this: &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;program&lt;/em&gt; that allows people to work together on files, projects, meetings and so on.&amp;ldquo;. And that underlines their severe lack of vision and plain immaturity which otherwise could have changed the face of the Internet. What it could have been is this: A &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt; that allows developers to build applications that could work online or offline with automatic real-time database and file replication. There is a huge difference between creating an &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt;. To put it in perspective, imagine Microsoft developers betting most of their time and energy to create vast variety of end user applications and paying little or no attention in producing well documented APIs, solid development tools and nurturing, supporting and enticing developer community to enable &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; to create applications. Would Microsoft have gone that way it would have become another Apple. And computers would still be privately manufactured expensive white boxes fancied by richies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why I like FireFox so much? If I was using it out of the box and without downloading any extensions, I would have dumped it in trash can right away. Without extentions support, it&amp;rsquo;s not that powerful and cool out of the box as those guys would have like you to believe. But enter the hundreds of cool extensions made by &lt;em&gt;other people&lt;/em&gt;, and FireFox is suddenly the most appealing and powerful browser to me. FireFox extension API has essentially became a platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to create a fast spreading powerful software, the bottom line is simple: Through people the plateform and thou shalt built apps upon it. Invest more in platform, not applications. Groove hasn&amp;rsquo;t learned this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, they are learning. They have VS.Net integration with GTK now, managed wrappers for lot of things, Developer Tools division, more then zero documentation and (are you ready?) even a book! But when you look at all these, you immediately realize that this effort to make Groove as a platform is more like an afterthought, a low priority, a low budget corporate &amp;ldquo;hobby&amp;rdquo; project and definitely an unfocused one. Before GTK came out some hardcore people were still trying to figure out how to use capabilities of Groove even if they had to use JavaScript APIs without documentation! And lot of them even then built cool apps. Imagine what if a real developer friendly platform was available wide open? How many applications would be built upon it? How many people would have downloaded Groove just to use those apps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So exactly how does Groove fails to deliver to developers? To start with, they are extremely reluctant to change, re-designing, re-factoring, modernizing and rewriting their aged stuff. Their original core engine C++ code and API design is beyond the edge of being outdated and that&amp;rsquo;s an understatement to fully describe the troubles with it. Groove APIs are exposed through COM and has a massive surface area combined with no documentation for much of the part. It&amp;rsquo;s bloated, broken and even not fully implemented in many cases. In latest version 3.0 they have changed their UI makeup (and file share performance) but they are still dragging along ancient under the hood code. Compare that to Microsoft rewriting and renewing their massive operating systems every 5 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current development aids for Groove aren&amp;rsquo;t just enough. Even if you are using VS.Net integration, lots of things needed for real world apps would require you to modify proprietary files in obscure places under the direction of support people. To publish a Groove tool there is &lt;a href=&#34;%20http://www.ischool.washington.edu/groove/solutions/groove_tool_publication.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;20+ step procedure&lt;/a&gt;with warnings signs: don&amp;rsquo;t screw up here. For anything more then &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; app, you would have no choice but to sign up with Groove as their partner and hire their super expensive consulting and support services (which on many instances just comes back with replies &amp;ldquo;we never thought you might want to do that with Groove. Sorry, that&amp;rsquo;s not possible.&amp;rdquo;). Groove doesn&amp;rsquo;t realise that the worst way to make money for them would be by squeezing the developer and proding them away for ever. And I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about launching rockets with Groove, but things as trivial as programmatically hiding left pan is simply not possible. And yes, they have the largest surface area API I&amp;rsquo;ve seen anywhere, including Windows. They haven&amp;rsquo;t reused almost anything: everything from files, data, installation - you name it - they have their own proprietary APIs that you need to learn from the scratch (I&amp;rsquo;d spent tons of time and energy to have them support standard ADO.Net instead of their properitory data API and we used it in our project but unfortunetely they have pulled it out from Groove 3.0). I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say those guys at Groove are uncompetitive (I&amp;rsquo;d been to their office for couple of days worth of meetings and those guys were smart and cool), it&amp;rsquo;s just bloated outdated design that they have to live with and work with. What a waste of an outstanding concept&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is lot more to it. Groove isn&amp;rsquo;t good and inviting to developers. Besides terrible &amp;ldquo;partner only access&amp;rdquo; schemes, you will also get recommendations to use their expensive personal training classes (I&amp;rsquo;d been to the one which was a week long). Can you imagine if FireFox didn&amp;rsquo;t fully document their APIs and asked you to sign up for their really expensive training if you&amp;rsquo;d wanted to make extentions for their browser? On most instances you would also end up hiring their &amp;ldquo;per hour&amp;rdquo; support and consulting staff to actually solve your problems that comes dozen a dime in real-world Groove development. I think several companies like IBM, Apple and Oracle workes just in this way and Microsoft is the only one to actually get developers on their side, give them nice tools and make things easily and freely accessible to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several bad unrealistic decisions made during Groove&amp;rsquo;s inceptions are still stuck with it even after almost a decade. For instance, Groove&amp;rsquo;s replicated store is maintained in the encrypted XML files rather then real relational database powerhouse. Those designers wanted plateform independence and they screwed up (such types of failures are becoming so common they deserve a name: &amp;ldquo;Cross-Plateform Wanna Be Failure Pattern&amp;rdquo;). Results? Groove sucks at scalability. In my experience, put more then 15 people in a space or more then 10,000 rows in &amp;ldquo;database&amp;rdquo; and you will be soon thinking about uninstalling Groove. Yet another example of carrying over ancient design misshapes is that the entire Groove engine works only from inside their proprietary &amp;ldquo;Transreceiver&amp;rdquo;. You can&amp;rsquo;t build your own EXE and consume those API from outside (actually you can at very limited extent but it&amp;rsquo;s so ugly even some internal gurus don&amp;rsquo;t want you to try that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what Groove could have been if they weren&amp;rsquo;t what they have become? Well, they could have given a birth to thousands of applications that could work either online and offline and anywhere. These vast variety of apps would have almost magical capability to synchronize their data with other people and computers. If you look beyond, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole new form of Internet and here is a highlight of what I mean: You won&amp;rsquo;t need a webserver to host your website. You could have just created a &amp;ldquo;space&amp;rdquo;, listed it somewhere and allowed open anonymous invitations to let anybody find it and browse it. So Internet would mostly become the collection of spaces hosted on individual computers instead of collection of web servers. It&amp;rsquo;s far more advanced then client-server model of current Internet and far beyond then traditional file-sharing P2P apps. In that form of Internet, there truely can not be any censorship. You can have your private television station and serve your content to millions of users through distributed P2P network without a need for expensive webservers and requiring huge bandwidth. Same would happen to audio communication that is currently being done by Skype: you get standard P2P plateform to build VoIP and PodCast servers. Traditional websites would have major facelift: HTML would have been replaced by interactive GUI tools that runs in space running under a secured account. Webistes are no more just HTTPs but are fully functional interactive GUI applications. So you see, lots of software you see around - everything from Kazaa to SETI distributed computing screensavers to &lt;a href=&#34;%20http://freenet.sourceforge.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Freenet&lt;/a&gt; to BitTorrent to Skype - are just specific instances of this technology. All of these applications are screaming for common P2P plateform and because there is none, each have their own quick and dirty homegrown one. If Groove concept was done right, it could have been this universal peer-to-peer computing plateform to do all of these in clear homogeneous way and there would have been an avalanche of next generation P2P applications. And that&amp;rsquo;s why I hate Groove for making it not happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jeff Hawkins - On Intelligence</title>

      <guid>http://shital.com/p/jeff-hawkins-on-intelligence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If all research papers were published the way Jeff Hawkins published his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onintelligence.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;On Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, the world would be a&amp;nbsp;different place to live. I strongly feel that this is the most important work in the field which is otherwise &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shitalshah.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=0b81a11a-0e5d-4ead-aeef-4552f52b0055&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;so bloated with wasted directionless efforts&lt;/a&gt;. This book is nothing like any research paper you might have read so far. It&amp;rsquo;s written in very personal way. Instead of just spitting out end product, thoughts and algorithms, author also tells you what other directions he was thinking about and what made him to go for this one. The book however is really low on technical &amp;ldquo;mojo&amp;rdquo;. Infect I just&amp;nbsp;barely found it technical enough to keep me interested.&amp;nbsp;The biggest missing&amp;nbsp;gap is&amp;nbsp;that author haven&amp;rsquo;t really formalized his ideas&amp;nbsp;on strong mathematical foundation. Also at times you would feel as if content is just too overly sweetened&amp;nbsp;and you can&amp;rsquo;t just let it push it through your throat&amp;nbsp;(talk about&amp;nbsp;pages and&amp;nbsp;pages of &amp;ldquo;for example&amp;rdquo; for one simple concept!), but hang on. A guy from Stanford, Dileep Geaorge, has done &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stanford.edu/~dil/invariance/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some work in formalizing authors ideas&lt;/a&gt; and even made a working software prototype showing that it successfully produces solid vision recognition. There are still few&amp;nbsp;missing links but I&amp;rsquo;ve hardly any doubts that this is the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Hawkins will be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nyas.org/events/eventDetail.asp?eventID=3379&amp;amp;date=2/2/2005%206:00:00%20PM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;giving a lecture&lt;/a&gt; at NY Science Acadamy tomorrow (2/2/2005).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stage is set.&lt;A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=http://shital.com/images/posts/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ProgressDialogDemo&#34; width=&#34;381&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-897&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg 381w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo-300x133.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you copy lot of files in Explorer, you see the standard Windows progress dialog with &amp;ldquo;flying papers&amp;rdquo; animation and the calculation of estimated time remaining. This dialog is accessible to any Windows application through &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/iprogressdialog/iprogressdialog.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IProgressDialog interface&lt;/a&gt;. This source code provides you a managed .Net wrapper to easily and intuitively integrate Windows Progress Dialog in your own applications. You can read more details in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9298/Using-Windows-Explorer-Progress-Dialog-In-Your-App&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my original article on CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;. Also see the comments in that article. It looks like two of the guys really hit on it and have produced a stand alone version.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Algorithms: Extract List Patterns, Word Clusters</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/algorithms-extract-list-patterns-word-clusters/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2004 13:59:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/algorithms-extract-list-patterns-word-clusters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2004/12/WordGroups.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2004/12/WordGroups.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;WordGroups&#34; width=&#34;1280&#34; height=&#34;744&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-907&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/WordGroups.jpg 1280w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/WordGroups-300x174.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/WordGroups-1024x595.jpg 1024w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This program demos two very interesting algorithms that I&amp;rsquo;d started designing during Fall 2004 and then got busy in other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First algorithm is simple which I call List Extractor and it finds the list like structures in any given text and extracts the data out of them. This enables automatic data extraction without prior knowledge of layout or formatting in web pages. If you look at lot of web pages, you will find that they just present some data in some repetative HTML formatting which I call a &amp;ldquo;list&amp;rdquo;. Examples are airlines schedules list, Google search results list, chronological experience list in resumes and so on. Challenge is to extract these lists from a page without knowing beforehand how this page has been laid out. Lot of web scrapping algorithms works on a fixed known layouts and by use of complex regular expressions. They will usually break if layout even changes slighly. This program demos my algorithm. Though I&amp;rsquo;d made some last minute changes which have affected its performance and accuracy. I&amp;rsquo;ll correct that as I get sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second algorithm is what I (and apparently now Google too) calls the &amp;ldquo;Word Clustering&amp;rdquo;. Basically the concept is that when you are looking at a genuinely informative webpage on a particular subject, say, General Relativity, you will tend to find (and intuitively expect) several other associated relevant words to appear on the same page such as metric, tensor, Riemann, geometry, gravity and so on. So these sets of words form a relevant &amp;ldquo;cluster&amp;rdquo; and they tend to appear together a lot. So by checking what kind of word clusters a page contains, it should be possible to find out what &amp;ldquo;topics&amp;rdquo; that page is talking about and you can also get some idea of the degree it&amp;rsquo;s genuinely informative. This program contains quick and dirty way to find Word clusters on a page (not fully implemented yet) including elimination of &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; words such as &amp;ldquo;is&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;are&amp;rdquo; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;obsolete&#34;&gt;
  Warning: This program was written circa Dec 2004 and last updated around Mar 2005. It is currently considered obsolete for most practical purposes. There are no plans to update it and no support is provided. It exists here purely for its historical and nostalgic value.

&lt;p&gt;This is an ASP.Net based sample website created for Highland Tech Highschool, AK. I like to show it as more of a demo for my SyFastPage framework. Nothing fancy here except that it was literally created overnight and it justifies &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; in the name SyFastPage. I&amp;rsquo;d initially decided to give a try to CodeCharge studio and automatically generate pages in about 5 hours that I&amp;rsquo;d i my hand but results weren&amp;rsquo;t professional and customizable as we wanted. So I dig up my old code in SyFastPage and put it to work. It also proved the point that I often make: Code generation sucks, reusable libraries rules.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Virtual By Default</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2004 20:33:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/virtual-by-default/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Omar &lt;a href=&#34;http://weblogs.asp.net/okloeten/archive/2004/11/15/257678.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blogs about an age-old debate&lt;/a&gt; on whether class members should be &lt;a href=&#34;http://artima.com/intv/nonvirtual.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;virtual-by-default or final-by-default&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s my take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my years of messing around with .Net class libraries, I would prefer virtual-by-default any day. Basically, when people designs their classes they really don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend much time on analyzing how &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; would be overriding a particular method - unless they are really sure that lot of people really wants to do that. And so it makes a logical sense to be pessimistic for a language designer and assume that something bad indeed will happen and disable overriding by default. The bad part of this pessimistic assumption is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go well with the real world statistics while its still logically pure and solid. In real world, you will find yourself in need so often to override a particular method, even if its &amp;ldquo;at your own risk&amp;rdquo;, and hack your way through to satisfy the requirements that original authors didn&amp;rsquo;t spend time thinking about. Usually most people will test their such &amp;ldquo;hacks&amp;rdquo; and know that they might be shooting a bullet in their foot. But an ideal language should allow them to do so with warnings - just like unsafe keyword - rather then making it impossible. You had done that rather then relying on original authors (such Microsoft) to come out with new functionality after half a decade or wrapping entire interface in your custom classes. The problem is that people does wish that their methods be extensible but they don&amp;rsquo;t have time to analyse all the side effects and make promises. My solution is that the compiler should just flag the warning that the method you are trying to override was not marked as virtual by default and may cause side effects (instead of current behavior of shadowing them). It should make all methods virtual unless specified otherwise and store additional metadata info that the method is virtual but wasn&amp;rsquo;t marked explicitly so. Forcing virtual or final keywords explicitly does not solve the problem because most people will choose final anyway to be idealistic as they still haven&amp;rsquo;t got time to analyze the side effects but those could have been statistically be mitigated by the authors who are willing to spend time in testing after they override.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the performance goes, I believe, authors of base class would much rather willing to spend time in finding hot-spot public methods and mark them as final rather then running complete analysis to decide if each of their methods could be virtual. So vote again goes for virtual-by-default.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you knew that &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/vbrkit/default.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Visual Basic.Net Resource Kit&lt;/a&gt; has an utility to convert C# code to VB.Net?

And that&amp;rsquo;s besides having cool Dundas Chart control and tons of other components from Component One absolutely free (though their charting component is pretty miserable and requires free registration for licensing). Charting is seriously missing component in 2.0&amp;rsquo;s toolbox.and I&amp;rsquo;m just &lt;a href=&#34;http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/ProductFeedback/viewFeedback.aspx?feedbackId=FDBK17664&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wondering&lt;/a&gt; why doesn&amp;rsquo;t MS thinks of bundling these components with VS.Net 2005 installer rather than keeping it in an lesser known corner of web.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Jeff Richter Screwing Up The .Net Versioning?</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/is-jeff-richter-screwing-up-the-net-versioning/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2004 21:51:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/is-jeff-richter-screwing-up-the-net-versioning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how no one is bothered by this. May be because &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=AssemblyVersioning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it affects Longhorn&lt;/a&gt;. But anyway, everybody would agree that while .Net solved the DLL Hell issue, it created its own which I affectionally call Assembly Hell and had &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/21462&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my rants&lt;/a&gt; loud from the start. I&amp;rsquo;d high hopes when I heard Jeff Richter is on the team. But be hold, they come up with the statement that the problem is &amp;ldquo;mathematically&amp;rdquo; unsolvable and some fuzzy argument to back up that statement and then they reveal possibly the worst versioning scheme I&amp;rsquo;ve heard in a decade for anything: divide the assemblies in &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; groups! I can&amp;rsquo;t even start to imagine someone could think of this kind of stupid idea for things that will hit the entire planet on massive scale. Must be an outcome of long meetings for days :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d been burned a lot by missing gaps in .Net versioning and problem is pretty simple if you had been in this mess. The solution is even amazingly simple for what it appears like a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental flow in the .Net versioning is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow to put a version number on assembly without breaking the compatibility. Once you understand this, lot many problems would be simplified. The &amp;lsquo;assembly version&amp;rsquo; is what we usually use for checking whether the file is really the one what we want and for deployment modules to make an update. While &amp;lsquo;compatible-to version&amp;rsquo; is for the run time to check if it should throw an error. So &amp;lsquo;assembly version&amp;rsquo; is different then &amp;lsquo;compatible-to version&amp;rsquo; and are not tied with each other. So all we need is one AssemblyXXX attribute that can let us specify what is the build number for this assembly and another AssemblyYYY to specify the version to which this assembly is still compatible from interface as well as behaviour point of view. You always auto-increment your assembly number on each build, but you do not change &amp;ldquo;compatible-to&amp;rdquo; number unless you really change the interface and behavior. And the problem is solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infect, here is a final surprise: you can do this right now in 1.x and 2.x. Use AssemblyVersion attribute to specify &amp;ldquo;Last Compatible-To&amp;rdquo; version and AssemblyFileVersion attribute to specify the build version. Things have been worked out perfectly for me with this scheme. Now when I hear about dumbest idea since COM versioning and &amp;lsquo;plateform&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;library&amp;rsquo;, I just think we are in for huge additional mess waiting that will take another release (another 10 years?) to clean up. Whether you agree or not, people, speak up!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is collection of several reusable components to use in your WinForms application. I&amp;rsquo;d been building it up and reusing in my own personal applications such as BrowserHistoryAnalyser and NotepadX and others. It contains editable drag-n-drop enabled TreeView, RichText editor control with toolbar, Worksheet editor control, Password Input Form, MRU, custom attributes you can use for your assemblies, more easily usable hidden property editor control, advanced About Dialog, Application Options management and Assembly Info Viewer Control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.x-setup.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;X-Setup&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most comprehensive Windows tweaking utility. I always end up spending half a day enabling all the hidden advanced settings using this thing. Fortunately it provides Recording mode and creation of a REG file. This is really cool because now with just a click I can make any XP/2003 machine more geekier and end lots of &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; annoyances. If you are interested you too can use my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/MiscDevFiles/blob/master/source/XSetup%20-%20All.reg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;final REG file&lt;/a&gt;. It would enable a whole range of features – everything from showing additional control panel applets, using double pans in explorer, removing Outlook attachment restrictions, showing file attributes in tooltip, adding new items in Explorer context menu, removing Shutdown Reason UI, kill everything quickly when shutting down and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to preserve logs of my browser history. Apart from recalling useful webpages I&amp;rsquo;d discovered, it helps to build kind of &amp;ldquo;journal&amp;rdquo; reflecting problems I was facing, things I was in to, things I was shopping and so on. An ability to look back and see what you were up to in any point of time is really important, not just useful. Unfortunately there is no easy way to export history from IE or Firefox, let alone query that data in an useful way. So this is the program I&amp;rsquo;d been putting some time on and off. The first version I&amp;rsquo;d made meant only for my personal and was a quick and dirty program in VB6 more then 5 years ago. Its latest incarnation is now rewritten from scratch in .Net 2.0 Beta1 and provides loads of functionalities in nice user interface. You can do all of followings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the browser history in to MS Access database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search your browser history with speed like Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge several history databases i to one (useful if you used multiple machines)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at all the queries you performed on Google, MSN and Yahoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics of how many websites you visit a day, how many unique URLs and domains you have visited so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to filter &amp;ldquo;noice&amp;rdquo; and random popup URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics of how much time you spend per page, how much time you spend per day in browsing websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chart the statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture of this new version is fairly extensible and you can plug-in more modules as you go. I&amp;rsquo;ll be implementing more public plug-in architecture and using plain XML files instead of MS Access databases and FireFox support (this is becoming important for me because I&amp;rsquo;ve 100% switched over to FireFox). So this is not yet the &amp;ldquo;release&amp;rdquo; version. Also note that you need .Net Framework Beta 2.0 Beta1 + VB.Net resource Kit if you want to compile the code. But results are beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing With DataViews</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/dealing-with-dataviews/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2004 18:50:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/dealing-with-dataviews/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never liked being forced to use DataView just to speed up my searches. Why not DataTable.Select() have an overload to generate internal indexes and do some smart things? But anyway, most people searching DataSet eventually would realizes that performance really sucks and they have no choice but to use DataViews, sometime whole bunch of it prepared for all sorts of queries you want to fire. Here are two things you should watch out (&lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemDataDataRowViewClassDeleteTopic.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MSDN docs&lt;/a&gt; aren’t clear about this):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you call myDataView(someIndex).Delete anywhere in your code, watch out that you do not access any other rows with index &amp;gt; someIndex. If you do, you might either get a run time error or even worse, you might be accessing row underneath that’s different then you actually wanted without any error. Another corollary: &lt;strong&gt;Never delete rows in DataView in forward loop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are changing/adding row in DataTable or other DataViews, do not forget to call row.BeginEdit and row.EndEdit. If you don’t, your changes will not appear in other views you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, performance gains through DataView is still pretty sweet thing to have 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DataSet, not XML</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/dataset-not-xml/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2004 18:09:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/dataset-not-xml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you need to store certain data in file, most of the time you will obviously think about storing it as XML file. Then soon you start drawing XML schemas and think about generating XSDs&amp;hellip; Well, stop! You might be making same mistake as many other people. The better idea is to design XML schema which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconloadingdatasetfromxml.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;loadable in DataSet&lt;/a&gt; rather then just &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemxmlxmldocumentclasstopic.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XMLDocument&lt;/a&gt;. This has tremendous advantages then your custom schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of thinking in hierarchical terms, you can now think in relational terms. I&amp;rsquo;ve often found that this simplifies lots of things. This means you can think how you will be storing your data in tables rather then XML hierarchies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schema generation gets simplified: You can draw actual database schemas using drag and drop in Access visually, set various properties for fields and generate XML schema using my utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can load your XML file right in to DataSet, create various &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/_mapping_xsd_relationships_to_dataset_relationships.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;relationships&lt;/a&gt; and access your data far more easily and with less code then directly using XMLDocument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have stuff in DataSet, you can do data bindings directly for quick demos or even use typed datasets - which is far more safer then always late bound XMLDocument objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In future, if you change your mind (and in most cases you will) to store your data in high performance databases rather then plain XML files, using DataSet in first place makes your job far more easier. Using DataSet compatible schemas allows you support plain XML files as well as real databases as your storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use SQL Server, its still a good idea to include possible support for Access mdb file along with plain XML file as your storage. Unlike plain XML files, Access single file databases allows you to fire far more complex queries rather then just XPath, generate reports write VBA scripts, set constraints, use security features and use other tons of utilities out there. Using DataSet compatible schemas lets you do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of dataset will let you migrate your application as becoming a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=Net%20Lead.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groove tool&lt;/a&gt; with far more ease. Once your app can sit in Groove transceiver, it would suddenly become a marvellous magic collaboration product! However note that Groove has not included their ADO.Net support in their 3.0 version but there are rumours that they eventually will. Currently the only way to have it is to use Groove 2.5 or upgrade from it to 3.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you manually enter data in your XML file (usually you might have to for unit tests, bug repro etc), you can do it in Access tables which is far more easier and save whole database as XML using my utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might make you wonder is there is any negative points in using DataSet compatible schemas. There are some, indeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some data which is inherently hierarchical are better represented using custom schemas. Trying to fit in relational table structure will cause to create several &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ehow.com/how_13626_define-many-many.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;many-to-many map tables&lt;/a&gt; and complicate the whole thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If XML file becomes large, there ways to read it using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/02/14/perlsax.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SAX parser&lt;/a&gt; rather then loading whole file in memory. Using DataSet directly will always load the whole file in memory and in general uses more of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom XML schemas are more &amp;ldquo;purer&amp;rdquo; to share across the platforms. However if you plan to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/about/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;, it already supports DataSets and that won’t be a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>When .Net Framework 2.0 Beta Messes You Up</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/when-net-framework-2-0-beta-messes-you-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2004 04:02:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/when-net-framework-2-0-beta-messes-you-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=916ec067-8bdc-4737-9430-6cec9667655c&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;.Net Framework 2.0 Beta&lt;/a&gt; and suddenly &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VS2K3.Net&lt;/a&gt; refuses to attach to your existing 1.1 apps with a very cool error message “Unable to attach to process”, don’t get panic! Looks like side-by-side promise of Framework versions doesn’t work in some rare cases (which somehow I always get in to). Unfortunately you can’t uninstall 2.0 (even though it gets installed in separate folder, core DLLs such as mscorlib.dll is already replaced by 2.0 version). The best way to make things work is to live with it and add this little snippet in your &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconapplicationconfigurationfiles.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[myapp].exe.config&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &#34;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/gngrfstartup.asp&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;startup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;
      &amp;lt;supportedRuntime version=&#34;v1.1.4322&#34;/&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/startup&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better way is, off course, install betas only in your &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VPC&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: If you ask what was that rare situation: This happens with &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=Net%20Lead.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groove tools&lt;/a&gt; you write with 100% managed code. In this case, you expose your &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=DMDComponents.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DMD&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/callnetfrcom.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CCW&lt;/a&gt; which Groove loads dynamically using ProgID and somehow it gets bind to 2.0 version. One more thing, I’ve heard that 2.0+ Frameworks will upgrade existing framework version rather then getting installed side-by-side. That might be it! In any case, your VS2003.Net will get screwed up, so above step is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read about Bayesian probability first on Paul Graham&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;milestone article on spam&lt;/a&gt; two years ago. Amazingly, his Bayesian based algorithm did the same thing that a sophisticated AI algorithm will do, i.e. to precisely identify spam emails (success rate: 995 out of 1000) just like humans do it with their image recognition, natural language processing capabilities and yet unparalleled intelligence. That got me interested and Bayesian probabilities got added in my things to learn. I just recently finished my that goal and I can&amp;rsquo;t over emphasize, its an serious weapon in your. The coolest way to understand Bayes is &lt;a href=&#34;http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;this article on web&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most others, this article states real equation at the end rather then at the start or middle of the article and author writes &amp;ldquo;By this point, Bayes&amp;rsquo; Theorem may seem blatantly obvious or even tautological, rather than exciting and new. If so, this introduction has entirely succeeded in its purpose.&amp;rdquo; Yes, indeed he is! One of the points that isn&amp;rsquo;t crystal clear in this article is the difference between P(A&amp;amp;B) and P(A|B). I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go on explaining that but you can see on left the small diagram that I created which will aid in understanding with above article. These two terms are actually the key in understanding why traditional probability analysis (which is about time independent calculations i.e. about probabilities that exist after all events have been finished occurring) is different then Bayesian analysis (which is about probabilities when we are still waiting for some events still to occur but we don&amp;rsquo;t know which one will really occur).&lt;/p&gt;

System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(&#34;Answer is &#34; + q.ToString());

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress-300x180.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TaskProgress&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-903&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress-300x180.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress.jpg 344w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an advanced progress dialog which can be shared among method calls which can call each other recursively. Each method call gets a portion of the total progress so we can see some continuous progress instead of only top level method progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is implemented by singleton version of TaskProgress using static public member which each method can use without being aware of other methods. This component keeps tracks of call recursion in a Stack and allocates progress bar range to each of the calls. Also the point of interest is the time remaining calculation which, if not sure, would show min-max range like &amp;ldquo;Time Remaining: 2 mins to 7 mins&amp;rdquo;. Please note that this is .Net 2.0 Beta1 code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample code for usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
/*** Pseudo Code ***/
public void Button1_Click(...) 
{       
    Progress.Show(0, 100);                  
    Progress.AllocateRangeForCallee(0,25);    //child updates would be mapped to range 0 to 25       
    Callee1();  //Callee would also attempt to show progress dialog too       
    Progress.Unload();      //ref count =0, this will actually unload 
} 

private void Callee1() 
{       
    //this won&amp;#39;t re-show, just increment the ref count       
    Progress.Show(0, 100);  //this range is mapped to what caller has allocated       
    ...         //do work and update progress       
    Progress.Unload();  // this won&amp;#39;t actually unload, just decrement the ref count 
} 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NotepadX is a powerful program to let you to keep your notes in hierarchically organized categories. Also it not just allows you to create rich text/ plain text notes but also the notes which are like Worksheet or a treeview! It also supports encrypted secured notes so you can save your passwords and sensitive information safely. You can also create read-only notes and pass it around. The Edit-In-Word allows you to use Word for rich text formatting in case my basic editor didn&amp;rsquo;t fit your needs. All your notes get saved in to one single XML file and for programmers, you have entire source code, several reusable components and nice object model if you need to tweak it. This has been my pass time project and several features are missing right now which I might work on in future, such as: integration with OneNote, search feature, export feature, merging of several notes etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just watched &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/Episode035/default.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MSDN TV&amp;rsquo;s new episode on Managed Code&lt;/a&gt;. The topic is pretty trivial for me but what&amp;rsquo;s exciting is to see one person talking and seating there. I remember my years as a rebellious programmer when followers were few and swimming opposite the popular currents wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. In all-Unix all-C++ organization I&amp;rsquo;d heavily pushed for tools and style I believed in - even if it meant taking over entire responsibility and work load on me. All those tools that I chose, used and appreciated for the vision it embedded, looked separate pieces of great ideas which just seem to happen to came on my way&amp;hellip; until there was one day when I read a magazine article and came to know there was really only one person behind all of those and all these years: Anders Hejlsberg. Those separate pieces of vision now seems to make a complete picture and so you can imagine how I would have stand in awe of him. As far as world of programming is concerned, Anders is my hero.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogger.com To dasBlog Converter Tool</title>

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; was previously hosted on Blogger.com and boy, that thing sucked. So my mission was to host my blog on my own site with an ASP.Net engine that I can customize and extend as I like. So DasBlog came along but there weren&amp;rsquo;t any tools around to fetch my blog entries from Blogger.com and put in to dasBlog. Sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to loose my previous entries, so I made my own conversion tool that does this export from blogger.com and import in to dasBlog. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good demonstration of how to use Blogger API, XML-RPC and use dasBlog engine. Infect you can use it with any host that supports Blogger API by changing server URI in Blogger.cs class. I used open source XML-RPC wrapper for .Net but had to tweak it and fix it a bit so this is more improved version :). You may note that, it imports entries in to dasBlog hosted on your localhost and not on remote server, so you will need to manually copy XMLs generated in Content folder on your local machines inetpub\wwwroot$$!dasBlog path]\Content to your remote server.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/05/RepoMiscDevFiles20140613.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/05/RepoMiscDevFiles20140613.png&#34; alt=&#34;RepoMiscDevFiles20140613&#34; width=&#34;210&#34; height=&#34;134&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1445&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the place I put any scripts, configurations worth saving. Some of the may be here from pure historical reasons so be careful in using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;copynewfiles-bat&#34;&gt;copynewfiles.bat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little batch file is just ROBOCOPY command line that I end up using too often. I&amp;rsquo;ve went through every command option to figure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;out if it should get in to this file. My main use of it is incremental copy of large folders for quick and dirty backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tidy1-cfg&#34;&gt;tidy1.cfg&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is config I created for HTML Tidy2 Plugin for Notepad++ after a lot of research. Goal of this config is to be robust and clean up even the mess as worse as the ones created by Microsoft Word. I use this anytime I have need to reformat HTML or fragments of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;git&#34;&gt;git*&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bunch of command lines that forms my Git workflow. I put these files in my global path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;xsetup-reg-obsolete&#34;&gt;Xsetup REG [Obsolete]:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This registry file is generated by X-Setup and contains lots of settings to make default Windows installation more suitable for geeks. This was usually the first thing I used to run after installing Windows until Vista came out. This is neither tested or recommended on later versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;bugdb-mdb-obsolete&#34;&gt;BugDB.mdb [Obsolete]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; says, Please never create yet another bug tracking system when your project finally needs it. While in the times of Github, basecamp and TFS, no one needs yet another bug tracking system, it used to be cottage industry just a decade ago. This file is my fair share in to the madness that I was forced to rig up in about an hour when frustration with other options just became unbearable. It&amp;rsquo;s bug tracking system entirely made up of MS Access in a single file! Customize all you want and take with you anywhere. If you are insane enough, please host it on your network share so everyone depends on it. And believe it or not, this little file had been actually used on real projects in early 2000s and people loved its simplicity and super quick customizability. This MDB contains all accessory queries, config data and data entry form to have you get started right away. Similar functionality is known to cost as much as $30000 :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/MiscDevFiles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MiscDevFiles is now archived at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SyFastPage - Churn Out Those Web Sites Faster!</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/syfastpage-churn-out-those-web-sites-faster/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2003 19:15:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/syfastpage-churn-out-those-web-sites-faster/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2003/03/tools_icon.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shital.com/images/posts/2003/03/tools_icon.gif&#34; alt=&#34;tools_icon&#34; width=&#34;40&#34; height=&#34;40&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1124&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my private library to build ASP.Net websites with one goal in mind: build it fast! I&amp;rsquo;ve already exploited it in building 3 of the websites (including this one) and one of them was literally built overnight! So well, it proves the point. This is still evolving code and there is not much documentation right now but you can contact me for assistance. Here&amp;rsquo;s what this library contains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templated themed page framework&lt;/strong&gt;: This is easier and different then others. It basically allows you to specify HTML file which will become your template an then you can put markers in that HTML file to indicate where would you want your site title, page title, site logo, menus etc. This is incredibly easy to use and pretty useful if you have raw HTML website and you want to use web forms and other bells and whistles of ASP.Net. This framework can get you started in couple of hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigational menu server control:&lt;/strong&gt; Really simplified menu server control. You set up your menu hierarchy as well as XHTML menu templates in XML file and this thing will paint it on your page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ListSet server control:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the heart of the site server control. It is a templated list in nutshell which means you give it a template (UserControl/ascx file) and it would instantiate that template for each row of the data. Inside your template you can use expression like &lt;code&gt;DataBinder.Eval(DirectCast(Container, DataGridItem).DataItem, &amp;quot;columnName&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; to paint that row in a way you like. Later if you want to change the look, you just modify template and you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to recompile. It nicely separates data and UI. Also it is derived from DataGrid instead of Repeater so it supports paging and other funky features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Stuff:&lt;/strong&gt; Website comments infrastructure, Some Web UI helper functions, Data functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;obsolete&#34;&gt;
  Warning: This program was written circa 2002 and last updated around Jan 2005. It is currently considered obsolete. There are no plans to update it and no support is provided.

      <title>Why VB.Net Is Better Than C#</title>
      <link>http://shital.com/p/why-vb-net-is-better-than-c/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2002 22:31:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://shital.com/p/why-vb-net-is-better-than-c/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, a candidate appearing for his first job interview right after school was put up with cold stare and a question: &amp;ldquo;So, what you know in C?&amp;rdquo;. The candidate kept his reply short with similar cold stare: &amp;ldquo;everything&amp;rdquo;. While candidate got the job very next day, the reply was unusual for interviewers because C was notorious for being deceptively complex language and it was believed that only few knew it&amp;rsquo;s real innards. So for decades, for most hard-core programmers, it had been a passion to meet every challenge and master it&amp;rsquo;s every intricacy. And still many of them knew it was becoming increasingly impractical to use it and compete against new RAD stuff like Delphi and VB. Even if we&amp;rsquo;d adapt to (some call it give in to&amp;rdquo;) RAD which had much weaker languages, we always kept our secret hidden love for C++ in our heart and hoped that our darling would be reincarnated one day to be back with us again. When I saw C# spec in .Net beta I was thrilled. The re-incarnation was finally happened. The C# is probably the best programming language yet that is modern, sophisticated, sexy and yes, has true RAD vision behind it. For more than a year, I&amp;rsquo;d aggressively fought to choose C# in anything I was doing until I started comparing it with VB.Net from good &amp;lsquo;ol productivity point of view. And this is really bad&amp;hellip; VB which I thought will be dead in coming years, seems to be winning again. I&amp;rsquo;m still reluctant to give final verdict and you are invited to pour in your opinions. While &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005YX8N&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the entire book&lt;/a&gt; is already devoted on this subject, here&amp;rsquo;s one of the most complete list of reasoning I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled from several sources and my observations on VB.net and C# pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct copy paste of large amount of existing VB6 code in to your .Net projects. I did this so many times until I realized what if I&amp;rsquo;d been writing code in C#?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option Strict can be turned on or off at will in VB.Net. With C# it&amp;rsquo;s not in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; control. This is really helpful to reduce unreadable ugly type casting when using COM interops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use either traditional On..Error or Try-Catch. With C# you only have later choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With VB.Net you can have &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; which is little cleaner then static classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier way to resize arrays in VB.Net and other functions like IsDbNull and exponentiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More granular way to shadow methods in derived classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No automatic indentation and removal of extra spaces. This slows you down plus your code looks little ugly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No automatic statement completion (for example VB.Net IDE automatically completes constructs like If-Then-Else)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No automatic casing. How many times your compilation failed because of stupid upper case/lower case mistakes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No redundant &amp;ldquo;;&amp;rdquo; after every statements. We originally loved this as C programmer but think about it: How many times you combined two statement in single line? Isn&amp;rsquo;t new line enough to mark end of 99% of the statements you usually write?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto completion of &amp;ldquo;()&amp;rdquo;. As usual, I love all kind of auto completions. Code must flow with speed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have to use escape sequences for &amp;ldquo;\&amp;rdquo; in XPath and file paths. This native C feature really becomes cumbersome and even worse can produce hard to find run time errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace provides for missing .Net functionalities like case insensitive string replace. While you can use it in C# also, it&amp;rsquo;s bit natural to use in VB.Net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VB.Net wires events in forms transparently (you can delete the event handler without compilation error)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VB.Net allows optional parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, C# also has it&amp;rsquo;s own share of advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much powerful and flexible language constructs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can do Operator overloading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use real memory pointers for performance code!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of original Microsoft and 3rd party code will be ported to C# rather than VB.Net. For example source code for DevXpress grid and many other is available only in C#&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better looking type cast statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much of Java, C++ Builder and VC++ code may be re-used - but with comparitively more care and may need more changes than using VB6 code in VB.Net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/002/097/msdncompositedoc.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shared Source CLI code&lt;/a&gt; is in C#&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devx.com/cplus/Article/9937&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New language features&lt;/a&gt; are announced for C# but not for VB.Net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi line comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C# can use native unsigned data types in .Net framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows XML documentation of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The great Using keyword in C# allows to do &amp;ldquo;deterministic finalization&amp;rdquo; in easy readable way for objects implementing IDisposible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is complete rewrite of WizAddIn and much more organized code but less tested. However you get nice document on how to use it and a test demo program too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. It does following of things: \ 1. Adds/removes line numbers from projects in a group. Unlike other add-ins, this one has been thoroughly tested on live complex projects for more then a year and has lots of code to workaround VB IDE object model bugs. It also does smart numbering (for example it won&amp;rsquo;t number trivial assignment statements in Property Get). 2. This add-in can also add error handlers in all methods. Again unlike other similar utilities, this one has been thoroughly tested, accepts a directive to turn off error handler and has some decision making code to decide whether an error handler would effect actual logic. 3. Fix for VB&amp;rsquo;s recent menu item bug (MRU) (you might have noticed VB&amp;rsquo;s Recent project item menu always gets messed up). is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0.

&lt;p&gt;I believe websites should give away their source code if you&amp;rsquo;d created it just for fun and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for money. So yes, here&amp;rsquo;s the source code of this whole website itself! Points of interests: SiteData.mdb contains most of the data in relational format which you can query, lots of examples of user controls that I use as templates in DataGrid rows and it is a good example of how my SyFastPage framework actually gets used. The code may be slighly out of date as I do not plan to always keep it synchronized. This website is active since 1998 and its implementation had moved from HTML/JavaScript to ASP to finally its present day ASP.Net. The source code contains only most recent implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unix users have taken for granted automatic insertion of a random quote-of-the-day in their emails since ages and that&amp;rsquo;s something Windows users still can&amp;rsquo;t do with their brilliant Ver. 10 of Microsoft Outlook. The situation usually gets unnoticed until you start getting those emails with quotes from a Linux guy and you find yourself incapable of &amp;ldquo;responding&amp;rdquo; with the similar cream-at-the-bottom. That was yesterday, however. The Outlook Quote is the cool answer to the quest and it does it all and more. It has very elegant user interface, extensibility, ease of use, ease of installation and complete seamless integration with Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to maintain several source branches in SourceSafe and constantly retrofitting your code around, this application can be tremendously helpful. It looks in to two specified SourceSafe folders, goes through all the files in them and finds out which files are different and performs various analysis in smarter way so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually check diffs manually. This application is in state of easy clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&amp;rsquo;s small utility that might do the trick. It goes through all your vbp, frm, ctl and replaces GUIDs of crazy OCXes with ones that you have. This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You will have to find out GUIDs of OCXes installed in your machine and replace it by hand in the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me you would be maintaining backups of things ranging from your favorite links to ICQ logs on writable CDs. But there is a snag. There would be lots of files on your disk that has names more then 60 characters - like the .lnk file in your Favorite folder! And that crashes the CD writing process regularly because normal CD file system doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow longer names. Solution? Sorten it! With this utility!

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual to see &amp;ldquo;Missing References&amp;rdquo; when you open the VB project and then take the pain of correcting them by hand. If it has became your daily routine and you are really tired of that, here&amp;rsquo;s the magic VB Add-In that will save you from that! This add-in monitors the state of references when you open the VB project. If it&amp;rsquo;s Missing or not proper, it will look in to VBP file and try to locate the DLL and correct that bad reference for you! Besides everything else, it shows how to write self-installing VB Add-In and some cool add-in techniques. If you said WOW, head on for download!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most wanted feature from users point of view in MS SQL Server is capability to generate INSERT scripts for MS SQL Server data. But call it Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s ignorance, this feature not supplied since quite long. And even worse, there is no public domain application to do that. This feature is usually desperately required in situation like sending test data to somebody or supply sample data. So I decided to write my own. It&amp;rsquo;s still isn&amp;rsquo;t the perfect and can&amp;rsquo;t handle all of the possibilities but it could be your best bet with supplied source code! This application is right now in state of easy installation but no on-line help is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This application scans the given folder and sub folders for VBP files, analyses which VBP file references which ones and generates a Tree view showing this relationships. What&amp;rsquo;s more, it stores this analysis results in Access database so that you can run your own query or open it at later time. This utility is typically useful if your project consists of tons of VB components calling each other and if you wish to see what will be the impact of changing interface of one on other components. You can also use it to just document component relationships between your projects. This application also shows you how to analyze VBP file contents and ready-to-use source code. This application is right now in state of easy clicks but no online help is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a little program to search for particular words in files in particular folder. Windows Find feature does search for a particular string in files but you can&amp;rsquo;t search for Word1 AND Word2 AND Word3. This program does just that. I made this program mainly to search for specific piece of code from 1000s of VB source code samples stored on my hard drive. This application is right now in state of easy installation and no on-line help is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visual Music lets you play 128 musical instruments on your PC including Flute, Bagpiper and even whistle! You can even record what you are playing, edit it and save it in a file. If you not expert at playing synthesiser keyboard, it provides you a easy to use scripting language to create music just by telling what key in which instrument you want to play for how much time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.planet-source-code.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Planet Source Code&lt;/a&gt; is one of the huge resources of VB code. Say you want to download all of it&amp;rsquo;s listing and make a CD that might serve as 1000s of VB code snippets. This program exactly does that. It&amp;rsquo;s actually general purpose program that downloads all the pages having address like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.somesite.com/some-junk/wanted_pageXXXX.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.somesite.com/some-junk/wanted_pageXXXX.htm&lt;/a&gt; - where XXXX is number ranging from 0000 to 9999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used same program to download all the postings in particular email list at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.listbot.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;www.listbot.com&lt;/a&gt;. This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You might have to modify the source code in clsListFetcher.GetAMessage to use it for different URLs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concept of trojan horses is not new. Programs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shitalshah.com/www.bo2k.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Back Orifice 2000&lt;/a&gt; silently stays in background in your PC, acts as TCP/IP server and allows somebody to connect it through Internet and execute commands sent by them. The REA2 (Remote Execution Agent) is my own trojan horse specifically designed for silent, full proof, reliable and powerfull intrusion and control. I crafted this gem in about 5 hours and comparing with BO2K, it lacks few features like real time screen display and mouse control and plug-ins but it&amp;rsquo;s designed to be much more &amp;ldquo;reliable and silent intrusion&amp;rdquo; and has some more capabilities then BO2K. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Delphi 3.0 to eliminate any runtime requirements. The EXE available here is a server. You can use any client that can connect to it on port 23145 and send the command as strings. My favorite client is my own PortTalk. I didn&amp;rsquo;t got much time to document these stuff (as usual it was fun program solely meant for me) but you can get the list of commands in TMainForm.ProcessReq function in main.pas file. This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You might have to modify the source code for your needs. However you may freely contact me for the assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 2 year old application is still the gem of it&amp;rsquo;s own. You can use this program to connect to any TCP/IP server, send it some commands and see how server responds. I used this program to learn how exactly browser makes request for a page to HTTP server or how other TCP/IP protocols like Ping and Time works. I started out my TCP/IP programming journey by reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rfc-editor.org/&#34; title=&#34;Request For Comment Documents By Internet Engineering Task Force&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RFCs&lt;/a&gt; on different protocols and actually experimenting with them using PortTalk. I&amp;rsquo;d made even my own HTTP server and utilities like PortTalk were indispensible while testing them. The advanced version allows you to connect to to REA2 server (see below) and do a file transfer. This application is right now in state of easy clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
