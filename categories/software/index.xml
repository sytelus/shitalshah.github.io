&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two files that contains all stories and comments posted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; from its start in 2006 to May 29, 2014 (exact dates are below). This was downloaded using simple program available I wrote  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News Downloader&lt;/a&gt; by making REST API calls to &lt;a href=&#34;https://hn.algolia.com/api&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HN&amp;rsquo;s official APIs&lt;/a&gt;. The program used API parameters to paginate through created date of items to retrieve all posts and comments. The file contains entire sequence of JSON responses exactly as returned by API call in JSON array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hnstoriesall-json&#34;&gt;HNStoriesAll.json&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contains all the stories posted on HN from &lt;code&gt;Mon, 09 Oct 2006 18:21:51 GMT&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Thu, 29 May 2014 08:25:40 GMT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-count&#34;&gt;Total count&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1,333,789&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;file-size&#34;&gt;File size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2GB uncompressed, 115MB compressed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-was-this-created&#34;&gt;How was this created&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a small program &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News Downloader&lt;/a&gt; to create these files, available at Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;format&#34;&gt;Format&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entire file is JSON compliant array. Each element in array is json object that is exactly the response that returned by HN Algolia REST API. The property named `hits` contains the actual list of stories. As this file is very large we recommend json parsers that can work on file streams instead of reading entire data in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-to-download&#34;&gt;Where to download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As GitHub restricts each file to be only 100MB and also has policies against data ware housing, these files are currently hosted at FileDropper.com. Unfortunately FileDropper currently shows ads with misleading download link so be careful on what link you click. Below is the screenshot FileDropper shows and currently the button marked in red would download the actual file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;few-points-of-interests&#34;&gt;Few points of interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API rate limit is 10,000 requests per hour or you get blacklisted. I tried to be even more conservative by putting 4 sec of sleep between calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to keep entire response from the call as-is. So return value of this function is used to stream a serialized array of JSON response objects to a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the output files are giant JSON files, you will need a JSON parser that can use streams. I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://james.newtonking.com/json&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JSON.NET&lt;/a&gt; which worked out pretty well. You can find the sample code in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In total 1.3M stories and 5.8M comments were downloaded and each took about ~10 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see all of HN stories and comments so far fits in to under just 1GB compressed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-and-suggestions&#34;&gt;Issues and Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know any issues and suggestions in comments. You can also file issue at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsData&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; Github repo&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d created for this data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing DSS</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/introducing-dss/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:04:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/introducing-dss/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are tons and tons of things to blog but here is a quick one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thanksgiving (a 4 days of holidays in USA) I wanted to work on something really cool that is absolutely worth doing and something I can spend my entire 4 days continuosly. I looked over my list of pending projects to find something extraordinarily cool, kept thinking about new ideas flowing around, looked over to other idea websites and realized that my mind was just keept going blank all the while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when people asked what were my plans for thanksgiving, I&amp;rsquo;d reply &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing Project Blank&amp;rdquo; :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just so happened, at the very start of the thanksgiving I was casualy reading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSE specs&lt;/a&gt; that was just announced by Ray Ozzie and immediately realized things missing in there and the huge possibilities of massive human collaboration that it can make happen. Rest of it is the story. I ended up spending about 16 hours a day in designing what I call now Data Syndication Services specifications and writing a reference application for it. While my efforts were inspired by SSE and Groove, the DSS design enables data sharing on a massive scale on much realistic grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what, I still call the project binaries Blank :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to take a look? Go ahead and collaborate &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/dss&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on my GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Groove Hacks</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/groove-hacks/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2005 05:48:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/groove-hacks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year and half ago, the new version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/astrila/messageexport/&#34;&gt;Groove&lt;/a&gt; had came out and it still didn&amp;rsquo;t had an ability export IMs. It drove me nuts so I started to write my own Groove tool that would do it in excuse to explore its infamous internals. Ah! What a ride that was! Groove APIs have extremely huge surface area (which means there are thousands and thousands of them sprinkled all over in hard to find places). Tons of them have confusing names, misleading functionalities and put in the wrong place. The fun part? There is almost no documentation! And yeah, did I forgot to mention that they are heavy C++ oriented, frequently late bound and mostly proprietary stuff (they even have their own proprietary definition for rich text and APIs!)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your brain needs some challenge that&amp;rsquo;s the place to dig in to. After sacrificing my 3 weekends I finally had a working tool that exports Groove IMs and put them to Outlook without loosing formatting or attachments! I consider this an equivalent feat of removing nag dialog of WinZip by changing a x86 jump instruction in its disassembled binary using only Visual Studio debugger and absolutely nothing else ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool had been sitting on my hard drive crying to get out for months and months. In between, I did some polishing up, adding wizards, support for Word and Excel, creating a help file and even created a website for it. So now I think it’s pretty much ready and have decided to give it away for free personal use (similar tools cost $50 something I guess). &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/astrila/messageexport/&#34;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt; if you use Groove and want to save your invaluable messages! Call it laziness or ignorance or whatever but I really do feel guilty not to putting this out early when 3.0 came out and lot of people SO need it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/my-new-codeproject-article-on-equation-rendering/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11406/Enable-Your-Users-to-Write-Math-Equations-in-Your&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my new article on CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;. The mission on MimeTeX was started about couple of months ago when in a weekend I just got attracted to MimeTeX&amp;rsquo;s C code like a magnet ;). Now I&amp;rsquo;ve built ASP.Net handler, caching, admin etc on the top of it and its looking great! Enabling scientific content on web seems to be my new obsession. So if you take pride in delighting your users with every new release, here&amp;rsquo;s your brand new feature! Go ahead, download it, use it! If you run in to any problem, I&amp;rsquo;ll be glad to offer you my help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Cool .Net Nuggets</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/some-cool-net-nuggets/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2005 22:00:46 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If type&amp;rsquo;s constructor (i.e. static constructor) throws an exception, entire type becomes unusable. Any attempt to call any member of that type would result in TypeInitializationException.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operator overloading should never be the only way to use the functionality if your code targets 1.x versions of frameworks because VB.Net can&amp;rsquo;t access it without resorting to ugly calls such as &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;op_Addition&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is universal symbol for money (a generic version of $, £, ¥ etc) and it&amp;rsquo;s ¤ (U+00A4). If you format the number as currency in culture invariant way then .net attaches this symbol to your number. I just think it&amp;rsquo;s cool to have some universal symbol for money :).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplest way to convert hex number to int: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Int32.Parse(&amp;ldquo;1AFF&amp;rdquo;, NumberStyles.HexNumber, null)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplest way to display array of bytes as hex values: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;BitConverter.ToString(byteArray)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you updated something in your computer and suddenly your .Net app behaves bad, it is possible to do automatic rollback.. The .Net Framework keeps track of assemblies that was loaded by any managed app up. This info is stored in an INI file in &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;LocalSettings\Application Data\ApplicationHistory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and is used by .Net Application Restore tool. I think this great debugging aid too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In .Net world, zombies are not purely an imagination: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Person
{
static object HoldOnToMe;
~Person()
{
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;HoldOnToMe = this;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
    GC.ReRegisterForFinalize(this);
}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Values types are allocated on stack but not when you have an array of value types. For example, &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;new Int32[100]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;allocates 100 unboxed integers on heap, not on stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finally block is not really always guaranteed to get executed. If any of these 3 special exceptions do happen, code in Finally won&amp;rsquo;t be executed: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OutOfMemoryException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;StackOverFlowException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExecutionEngineException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;d be fortunate enough to experience all of these). That means you had created some global kernel objects, they will indeed hang around and may interfere when user restarts your app. BTW, if you see a code like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;catch(Exception ex) {...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;catch{...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;, tell the developer that he has committed a sin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently GC.Collect() is not always a line of code you should disgust at. You might want to do it especially when you &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; the process and had created loads of objects which won&amp;rsquo;t be used any further (for example moving on to a new tab in WinForms app). I used this in one of my projects to improve on the memory pressure and was really feeling guilty about it, until recently. &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;        GC.Collect();
//block my thread till objects needing finalization are done
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
GC.Collect();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should always strong name your assemblies, especially if it is going to be used by assemblies in multiple AppDomains in the same process because only they are shared between domains; otherwise each AppDomain will have it&amp;rsquo;s own copy. Why anyone would have multiple AppDomains, you ask. Well, if you are enabling your app to have 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party plugins, I strongly recommend loading all these plugins in to a separate domain. This way not only you can control the security policy on these plugins but also unload the bad plugins without shutting down your app. This is often overlooked in various plugin architectures for .Net but if you don&amp;rsquo;t do this, you app might go on the same route as IE6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have enabled your app or website for localization, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to test it with Turkish language. If your thread is having CurrentCulture Turkish (tr-TR) and if you try to uppercase a letter i, you get 0 instead of normal english I (i.e. Unicode character U+0130 instead of U+0049). Scott Hanselman has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UpdateOnTheDasBlogTurkishIBugAndAReminderToMeOnGlobalization.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a first hand experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you know Application.ThreadException event which lets you capture the unhandled exceptions in WinForms app and do something like Windows Error Reporting. But the better way is probably &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AppDomain.UnhandledException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;event because that also lets you get notified for non-CLS compliant exceptions and without needing a reference to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                    

&lt;p&gt;object.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The values of public constants that you reference from other assemblies are embedded in your own assembly metadata. That means, if other assembly changes the value of the constant afterwards, you must recompile your own assembly or otherwise you still will be using that old value of the constant. I think this is as critical &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/27597&#34; title=&#34;My post on OT list about how troublesome this problem could be&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lapsed event handlers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jagged arrays are not CLS compliant. If you are building a library that can be used by VB or C# guys, you can&amp;rsquo;t have jagged arrays as public member type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Basic can do this: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Try
&amp;hellip;
Catch e as Exception &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;When x = 0&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
&amp;hellip;
End try
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Integrating RSS And Calendar Essay Available Now</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/integrating-rss-and-calendar-essay-available-now/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of wrapping calendar information in to the RSS feed may sound very appealing. Almost every website owned by some kind of group or organization has their event calendar. The thought that you can aggregate them in to your &amp;ldquo;Calendar Aggregator&amp;rdquo; is just so geekily cool. What if people started putting up their weekend plans through some kind of RSS-Calendar and you can subscribe to them in your calendar program! I dig through dozens of W3C and other specs and half a dozen of implementation to find out what has been done so far and why it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet. The result of my findings and possible solution are summarized in &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/integrating-rss-and-calendar/&#34;&gt;my essay&lt;/a&gt; in some reader friendly writing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updates - Spring 2005</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would be writing all New York City related stuff at &lt;a href=&#34;http://nyc.metblogs.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Metblogs&lt;/a&gt; rather then my own blog. This makes sense because lot of people who aren&amp;rsquo;t in this region doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to get those NYC stories. On the other hand, my NYC related writing will now reach to much larger audience. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=site:nyc.metblogs.com+%22shital+shah%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;c2coff=1&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;filter=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some of my entries there&lt;/a&gt; about cool New York events, restaurants and such stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other site news, you might have noticed new skin and more FireFox friendly design. I also decided to give away the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/SyFastPage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;engine that my website runs on&lt;/a&gt; (C# code I wrote almost 4 years ago) along with entire &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/ShitalShahWebV3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source code for this website&lt;/a&gt; (thats in VB.Net just for fun). Nothing special but main highlights of the engine is that it accepts raw HTML file as the base template and embeds your dynamic ASP.Net WebForm content inside that HTML. It also provides navigation control which runs off of XHTML templates and XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like my free utilities, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/category/software/&#34;&gt;massive updates in my Software section&lt;/a&gt;. It has now many more of my programs and utilities that I kept it to myself. Specifically, the one called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/BrowserHistoryAnalyzer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Browser History Analyzer&lt;/a&gt; analyses your IE history (support for FireFox coming soon), builds MS Access database and gives you tons of amusing info about your browsing habits such has the queries you fired on search engine, how do you refine your keywords progressively, how much time you usually spend on a page, how much time you spend on browsing and so on. Whilte still in development, it also features extensible architecture to let you make your own plugins. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put the link for article I wrote for CodeProject about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/WinProgressDialog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how to show Explorer&amp;rsquo;s progress dialog in your apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally some &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/photos/111712720654017421562/albums/5987178406068558081&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alaska trip photos&lt;/a&gt; also have been added. Yenjoy :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Windows Explorer Progress Dialog In Your Application</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/using-windows-explorer-progress-dialog-in-your-application/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2004 19:37:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/using-windows-explorer-progress-dialog-in-your-application/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ProgressDialogDemo&#34; width=&#34;381&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-897&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg 381w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo-300x133.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you copy lot of files in Explorer, you see the standard Windows progress dialog with &amp;ldquo;flying papers&amp;rdquo; animation and the calculation of estimated time remaining. This dialog is accessible to any Windows application through &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/iprogressdialog/iprogressdialog.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IProgressDialog interface&lt;/a&gt;. This source code provides you a managed .Net wrapper to easily and intuitively integrate Windows Progress Dialog in your own applications. You can read more details in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9298/Using-Windows-Explorer-Progress-Dialog-In-Your-App&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my original article on CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;. Also see the comments in that article. It looks like two of the guys really hit on it and have produced a stand alone version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;obsolete&#34;&gt;
  Warning: This program was last updated on 13 Jan 2005 and is considered &lt;em&gt;obsolete&lt;/em&gt;. There are no plans to update it and no support is provided. It exists here purely for its historical and nostalgic value.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/WinProgressDialog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WinProgressDialog is now archived at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Jeff Richter Screwing Up The .Net Versioning?</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/is-jeff-richter-screwing-up-the-net-versioning/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2004 21:51:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/is-jeff-richter-screwing-up-the-net-versioning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how no one is bothered by this. May be because &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=AssemblyVersioning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it affects Longhorn&lt;/a&gt;. But anyway, everybody would agree that while .Net solved the DLL Hell issue, it created its own which I affectionally call Assembly Hell and had &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/21462&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my rants&lt;/a&gt; loud from the start. I&amp;rsquo;d high hopes when I heard Jeff Richter is on the team. But be hold, they come up with the statement that the problem is &amp;ldquo;mathematically&amp;rdquo; unsolvable and some fuzzy argument to back up that statement and then they reveal possibly the worst versioning scheme I&amp;rsquo;ve heard in a decade for anything: divide the assemblies in &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; groups! I can&amp;rsquo;t even start to imagine someone could think of this kind of stupid idea for things that will hit the entire planet on massive scale. Must be an outcome of long meetings for days :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d been burned a lot by missing gaps in .Net versioning and problem is pretty simple if you had been in this mess. The solution is even amazingly simple for what it appears like a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental flow in the .Net versioning is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow to put a version number on assembly without breaking the compatibility. Once you understand this, lot many problems would be simplified. The &amp;lsquo;assembly version&amp;rsquo; is what we usually use for checking whether the file is really the one what we want and for deployment modules to make an update. While &amp;lsquo;compatible-to version&amp;rsquo; is for the run time to check if it should throw an error. So &amp;lsquo;assembly version&amp;rsquo; is different then &amp;lsquo;compatible-to version&amp;rsquo; and are not tied with each other. So all we need is one AssemblyXXX attribute that can let us specify what is the build number for this assembly and another AssemblyYYY to specify the version to which this assembly is still compatible from interface as well as behaviour point of view. You always auto-increment your assembly number on each build, but you do not change &amp;ldquo;compatible-to&amp;rdquo; number unless you really change the interface and behavior. And the problem is solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infect, here is a final surprise: you can do this right now in 1.x and 2.x. Use AssemblyVersion attribute to specify &amp;ldquo;Last Compatible-To&amp;rdquo; version and AssemblyFileVersion attribute to specify the build version. Things have been worked out perfectly for me with this scheme. Now when I hear about dumbest idea since COM versioning and &amp;lsquo;plateform&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;library&amp;rsquo;, I just think we are in for huge additional mess waiting that will take another release (another 10 years?) to clean up. Whether you agree or not, people, speak up!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is collection of several reusable components to use in your WinForms application. I&amp;rsquo;d been building it up and reusing in my own personal applications such as BrowserHistoryAnalyser and NotepadX and others. It contains editable drag-n-drop enabled TreeView, RichText editor control with toolbar, Worksheet editor control, Password Input Form, MRU, custom attributes you can use for your assemblies, more easily usable hidden property editor control, advanced About Dialog, Application Options management and Assembly Info Viewer Control.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.x-setup.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;X-Setup&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most comprehensive Windows tweaking utility. I always end up spending half a day enabling all the hidden advanced settings using this thing. Fortunately it provides Recording mode and creation of a REG file. This is really cool because now with just a click I can make any XP/2003 machine more geekier and end lots of &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; annoyances. If you are interested you too can use my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/MiscDevFiles/blob/master/source/XSetup%20-%20All.reg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;final REG file&lt;/a&gt;. It would enable a whole range of features – everything from showing additional control panel applets, using double pans in explorer, removing Outlook attachment restrictions, showing file attributes in tooltip, adding new items in Explorer context menu, removing Shutdown Reason UI, kill everything quickly when shutting down and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to preserve logs of my browser history. Apart from recalling useful webpages I&amp;rsquo;d discovered, it helps to build kind of &amp;ldquo;journal&amp;rdquo; reflecting problems I was facing, things I was in to, things I was shopping and so on. An ability to look back and see what you were up to in any point of time is really important, not just useful. Unfortunately there is no easy way to export history from IE or Firefox, let alone query that data in an useful way. So this is the program I&amp;rsquo;d been putting some time on and off. The first version I&amp;rsquo;d made meant only for my personal and was a quick and dirty program in VB6 more then 5 years ago. Its latest incarnation is now rewritten from scratch in .Net 2.0 Beta1 and provides loads of functionalities in nice user interface. You can do all of followings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the browser history in to MS Access database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search your browser history with speed like Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge several history databases i to one (useful if you used multiple machines)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at all the queries you performed on Google, MSN and Yahoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics of how many websites you visit a day, how many unique URLs and domains you have visited so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to filter &amp;ldquo;noice&amp;rdquo; and random popup URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics of how much time you spend per page, how much time you spend per day in browsing websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chart the statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture of this new version is fairly extensible and you can plug-in more modules as you go. I&amp;rsquo;ll be implementing more public plug-in architecture and using plain XML files instead of MS Access databases and FireFox support (this is becoming important for me because I&amp;rsquo;ve 100% switched over to FireFox). So this is not yet the &amp;ldquo;release&amp;rdquo; version. Also note that you need .Net Framework Beta 2.0 Beta1 + VB.Net resource Kit if you want to compile the code. But results are beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing With DataViews</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never liked being forced to use DataView just to speed up my searches. Why not DataTable.Select() have an overload to generate internal indexes and do some smart things? But anyway, most people searching DataSet eventually would realizes that performance really sucks and they have no choice but to use DataViews, sometime whole bunch of it prepared for all sorts of queries you want to fire. Here are two things you should watch out (&lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemDataDataRowViewClassDeleteTopic.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MSDN docs&lt;/a&gt; aren’t clear about this):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you call myDataView(someIndex).Delete anywhere in your code, watch out that you do not access any other rows with index &amp;gt; someIndex. If you do, you might either get a run time error or even worse, you might be accessing row underneath that’s different then you actually wanted without any error. Another corollary: &lt;strong&gt;Never delete rows in DataView in forward loop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are changing/adding row in DataTable or other DataViews, do not forget to call row.BeginEdit and row.EndEdit. If you don’t, your changes will not appear in other views you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, performance gains through DataView is still pretty sweet thing to have 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DataSet, not XML</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dataset-not-xml/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2004 18:09:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dataset-not-xml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you need to store certain data in file, most of the time you will obviously think about storing it as XML file. Then soon you start drawing XML schemas and think about generating XSDs&amp;hellip; Well, stop! You might be making same mistake as many other people. The better idea is to design XML schema which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconloadingdatasetfromxml.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;loadable in DataSet&lt;/a&gt; rather then just &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemxmlxmldocumentclasstopic.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XMLDocument&lt;/a&gt;. This has tremendous advantages then your custom schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of thinking in hierarchical terms, you can now think in relational terms. I&amp;rsquo;ve often found that this simplifies lots of things. This means you can think how you will be storing your data in tables rather then XML hierarchies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schema generation gets simplified: You can draw actual database schemas using drag and drop in Access visually, set various properties for fields and generate XML schema using my utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can load your XML file right in to DataSet, create various &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/_mapping_xsd_relationships_to_dataset_relationships.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;relationships&lt;/a&gt; and access your data far more easily and with less code then directly using XMLDocument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have stuff in DataSet, you can do data bindings directly for quick demos or even use typed datasets - which is far more safer then always late bound XMLDocument objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In future, if you change your mind (and in most cases you will) to store your data in high performance databases rather then plain XML files, using DataSet in first place makes your job far more easier. Using DataSet compatible schemas allows you support plain XML files as well as real databases as your storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use SQL Server, its still a good idea to include possible support for Access mdb file along with plain XML file as your storage. Unlike plain XML files, Access single file databases allows you to fire far more complex queries rather then just XPath, generate reports write VBA scripts, set constraints, use security features and use other tons of utilities out there. Using DataSet compatible schemas lets you do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of dataset will let you migrate your application as becoming a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=Net%20Lead.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groove tool&lt;/a&gt; with far more ease. Once your app can sit in Groove transceiver, it would suddenly become a marvellous magic collaboration product! However note that Groove has not included their ADO.Net support in their 3.0 version but there are rumours that they eventually will. Currently the only way to have it is to use Groove 2.5 or upgrade from it to 3.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you manually enter data in your XML file (usually you might have to for unit tests, bug repro etc), you can do it in Access tables which is far more easier and save whole database as XML using my utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might make you wonder is there is any negative points in using DataSet compatible schemas. There are some, indeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some data which is inherently hierarchical are better represented using custom schemas. Trying to fit in relational table structure will cause to create several &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ehow.com/how_13626_define-many-many.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;many-to-many map tables&lt;/a&gt; and complicate the whole thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If XML file becomes large, there ways to read it using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/02/14/perlsax.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SAX parser&lt;/a&gt; rather then loading whole file in memory. Using DataSet directly will always load the whole file in memory and in general uses more of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom XML schemas are more &amp;ldquo;purer&amp;rdquo; to share across the platforms. However if you plan to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/about/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;, it already supports DataSets and that won’t be a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>When .Net Framework 2.0 Beta Messes You Up</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/when-net-framework-2-0-beta-messes-you-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2004 04:02:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/when-net-framework-2-0-beta-messes-you-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=916ec067-8bdc-4737-9430-6cec9667655c&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;.Net Framework 2.0 Beta&lt;/a&gt; and suddenly &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VS2K3.Net&lt;/a&gt; refuses to attach to your existing 1.1 apps with a very cool error message “Unable to attach to process”, don’t get panic! Looks like side-by-side promise of Framework versions doesn’t work in some rare cases (which somehow I always get in to). Unfortunately you can’t uninstall 2.0 (even though it gets installed in separate folder, core DLLs such as mscorlib.dll is already replaced by 2.0 version). The best way to make things work is to live with it and add this little snippet in your &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconapplicationconfigurationfiles.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[myapp].exe.config&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &#34;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/gngrfstartup.asp&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;startup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;
      &amp;lt;supportedRuntime version=&#34;v1.1.4322&#34;/&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/startup&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better way is, off course, install betas only in your &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VPC&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: If you ask what was that rare situation: This happens with &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=Net%20Lead.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groove tools&lt;/a&gt; you write with 100% managed code. In this case, you expose your &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=DMDComponents.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DMD&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/callnetfrcom.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CCW&lt;/a&gt; which Groove loads dynamically using ProgID and somehow it gets bind to 2.0 version. One more thing, I’ve heard that 2.0+ Frameworks will upgrade existing framework version rather then getting installed side-by-side. That might be it! In any case, your VS2003.Net will get screwed up, so above step is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Besides doing everything that you ever wanted from a thing called Task Manager (even showing open files for every process), it has one of the sweetest option that your application should provide: Replace Windows native [equivalent thing]! I just keep wishing if there had been free and with-source Calculators and Explorers and everything else Windows that I can just replace with a click like this and move on rather then &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2002/09/27.html#a1547&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;waiting for a decade&lt;/a&gt; on Microsoft to improve their &lt;a href=&#34;http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.windows.off-topic/5339&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;age old featureless&lt;/a&gt; apps. So when you are getting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stardock.com/products/windowblinds/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cool skinable Windows&lt;/a&gt;?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This innocent little puzzle formed from some of the recent code I was writing. Lets see if it gets you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;object p = 2;
object q = p;
p = 4;
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(&#34;Answer is &#34; + q.ToString());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I&amp;rsquo;m having fun asking it to my colleagues 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recursion Enabled Task Progress Dialog</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/recursion-enabled-task-progress-dialog/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2004 10:37:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/recursion-enabled-task-progress-dialog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress-300x180.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TaskProgress&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-903&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress-300x180.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress.jpg 344w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an advanced progress dialog which can be shared among method calls which can call each other recursively. Each method call gets a portion of the total progress so we can see some continuous progress instead of only top level method progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is implemented by singleton version of TaskProgress using static public member which each method can use without being aware of other methods. This component keeps tracks of call recursion in a Stack and allocates progress bar range to each of the calls. Also the point of interest is the time remaining calculation which, if not sure, would show min-max range like &amp;ldquo;Time Remaining: 2 mins to 7 mins&amp;rdquo;. Please note that this is .Net 2.0 Beta1 code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample code for usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
/*** Pseudo Code ***/
public void Button1_Click(...) 
{       
    Progress.Show(0, 100);                  
    Progress.AllocateRangeForCallee(0,25);    //child updates would be mapped to range 0 to 25       
    Callee1();  //Callee would also attempt to show progress dialog too       
    Progress.Unload();      //ref count =0, this will actually unload 
} 

private void Callee1() 
{       
    //this won&amp;#39;t re-show, just increment the ref count       
    Progress.Show(0, 100);  //this range is mapped to what caller has allocated       
    ...         //do work and update progress       
    Progress.Unload();  // this won&amp;#39;t actually unload, just decrement the ref count 
} 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NotepadX is a powerful program to let you to keep your notes in hierarchically organized categories. Also it not just allows you to create rich text/ plain text notes but also the notes which are like Worksheet or a treeview! It also supports encrypted secured notes so you can save your passwords and sensitive information safely. You can also create read-only notes and pass it around. The Edit-In-Word allows you to use Word for rich text formatting in case my basic editor didn&amp;rsquo;t fit your needs. All your notes get saved in to one single XML file and for programmers, you have entire source code, several reusable components and nice object model if you need to tweak it. This has been my pass time project and several features are missing right now which I might work on in future, such as: integration with OneNote, search feature, export feature, merging of several notes etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just watched &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/Episode035/default.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MSDN TV&amp;rsquo;s new episode on Managed Code&lt;/a&gt;. The topic is pretty trivial for me but what&amp;rsquo;s exciting is to see one person talking and seating there. I remember my years as a rebellious programmer when followers were few and swimming opposite the popular currents wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. In all-Unix all-C++ organization I&amp;rsquo;d heavily pushed for tools and style I believed in - even if it meant taking over entire responsibility and work load on me. All those tools that I chose, used and appreciated for the vision it embedded, looked separate pieces of great ideas which just seem to happen to came on my way&amp;hellip; until there was one day when I read a magazine article and came to know there was really only one person behind all of those and all these years: Anders Hejlsberg. Those separate pieces of vision now seems to make a complete picture and so you can imagine how I would have stand in awe of him. As far as world of programming is concerned, Anders is my hero.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogger.com To dasBlog Converter Tool</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/Blogger2dasBlog.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/Blogger2dasBlog-300x214.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Blogger2dasBlog&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-891&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/Blogger2dasBlog-300x214.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/Blogger2dasBlog.jpg 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; was previously hosted on Blogger.com and boy, that thing sucked. So my mission was to host my blog on my own site with an ASP.Net engine that I can customize and extend as I like. So DasBlog came along but there weren&amp;rsquo;t any tools around to fetch my blog entries from Blogger.com and put in to dasBlog. Sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to loose my previous entries, so I made my own conversion tool that does this export from blogger.com and import in to dasBlog. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good demonstration of how to use Blogger API, XML-RPC and use dasBlog engine. Infect you can use it with any host that supports Blogger API by changing server URI in Blogger.cs class. I used open source XML-RPC wrapper for .Net but had to tweak it and fix it a bit so this is more improved version :). You may note that, it imports entries in to dasBlog hosted on your localhost and not on remote server, so you will need to manually copy XMLs generated in Content folder on your local machines inetpub\wwwroot$$!dasBlog path]\Content to your remote server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/05/RepoMiscDevFiles20140613.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/05/RepoMiscDevFiles20140613.png&#34; alt=&#34;RepoMiscDevFiles20140613&#34; width=&#34;210&#34; height=&#34;134&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1445&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the place I put any scripts, configurations worth saving. Some of the may be here from pure historical reasons so be careful in using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;copynewfiles-bat&#34;&gt;copynewfiles.bat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little batch file is just ROBOCOPY command line that I end up using too often. I&amp;rsquo;ve went through every command option to figure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;out if it should get in to this file. My main use of it is incremental copy of large folders for quick and dirty backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tidy1-cfg&#34;&gt;tidy1.cfg&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is config I created for HTML Tidy2 Plugin for Notepad++ after a lot of research. Goal of this config is to be robust and clean up even the mess as worse as the ones created by Microsoft Word. I use this anytime I have need to reformat HTML or fragments of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;git&#34;&gt;git*&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bunch of command lines that forms my Git workflow. I put these files in my global path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;xsetup-reg-obsolete&#34;&gt;Xsetup REG [Obsolete]:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This registry file is generated by X-Setup and contains lots of settings to make default Windows installation more suitable for geeks. This was usually the first thing I used to run after installing Windows until Vista came out. This is neither tested or recommended on later versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;bugdb-mdb-obsolete&#34;&gt;BugDB.mdb [Obsolete]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; says, Please never create yet another bug tracking system when your project finally needs it. While in the times of Github, basecamp and TFS, no one needs yet another bug tracking system, it used to be cottage industry just a decade ago. This file is my fair share in to the madness that I was forced to rig up in about an hour when frustration with other options just became unbearable. It&amp;rsquo;s bug tracking system entirely made up of MS Access in a single file! Customize all you want and take with you anywhere. If you are insane enough, please host it on your network share so everyone depends on it. And believe it or not, this little file had been actually used on real projects in early 2000s and people loved its simplicity and super quick customizability. This MDB contains all accessory queries, config data and data entry form to have you get started right away. Similar functionality is known to cost as much as $30000 :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/MiscDevFiles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MiscDevFiles is now archived at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SyFastPage - Churn Out Those Web Sites Faster!</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/syfastpage-churn-out-those-web-sites-faster/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2003 19:15:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/syfastpage-churn-out-those-web-sites-faster/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2003/03/tools_icon.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2003/03/tools_icon.gif&#34; alt=&#34;tools_icon&#34; width=&#34;40&#34; height=&#34;40&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1124&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my private library to build ASP.Net websites with one goal in mind: build it fast! I&amp;rsquo;ve already exploited it in building 3 of the websites (including this one) and one of them was literally built overnight! So well, it proves the point. This is still evolving code and there is not much documentation right now but you can contact me for assistance. Here&amp;rsquo;s what this library contains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templated themed page framework&lt;/strong&gt;: This is easier and different then others. It basically allows you to specify HTML file which will become your template an then you can put markers in that HTML file to indicate where would you want your site title, page title, site logo, menus etc. This is incredibly easy to use and pretty useful if you have raw HTML website and you want to use web forms and other bells and whistles of ASP.Net. This framework can get you started in couple of hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigational menu server control:&lt;/strong&gt; Really simplified menu server control. You set up your menu hierarchy as well as XHTML menu templates in XML file and this thing will paint it on your page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ListSet server control:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the heart of the site server control. It is a templated list in nutshell which means you give it a template (UserControl/ascx file) and it would instantiate that template for each row of the data. Inside your template you can use expression like &lt;code&gt;DataBinder.Eval(DirectCast(Container, DataGridItem).DataItem, &amp;quot;columnName&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; to paint that row in a way you like. Later if you want to change the look, you just modify template and you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to recompile. It nicely separates data and UI. Also it is derived from DataGrid instead of Repeater so it supports paging and other funky features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Stuff:&lt;/strong&gt; Website comments infrastructure, Some Web UI helper functions, Data functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. It does following of things: \ 1. Adds/removes line numbers from projects in a group. Unlike other add-ins, this one has been thoroughly tested on live complex projects for more then a year and has lots of code to workaround VB IDE object model bugs. It also does smart numbering (for example it won&amp;rsquo;t number trivial assignment statements in Property Get). 2. This add-in can also add error handlers in all methods. Again unlike other similar utilities, this one has been thoroughly tested, accepts a directive to turn off error handler and has some decision making code to decide whether an error handler would effect actual logic. 3. Fix for VB&amp;rsquo;s recent menu item bug (MRU) (you might have noticed VB&amp;rsquo;s Recent project item menu always gets messed up). is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0.

&lt;p&gt;I believe websites should give away their source code if you&amp;rsquo;d created it just for fun and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for money. So yes, here&amp;rsquo;s the source code of this whole website itself! Points of interests: SiteData.mdb contains most of the data in relational format which you can query, lots of examples of user controls that I use as templates in DataGrid rows and it is a good example of how my SyFastPage framework actually gets used. The code may be slighly out of date as I do not plan to always keep it synchronized. This website is active since 1998 and its implementation had moved from HTML/JavaScript to ASP to finally its present day ASP.Net. The source code contains only most recent implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unix users have taken for granted automatic insertion of a random quote-of-the-day in their emails since ages and that&amp;rsquo;s something Windows users still can&amp;rsquo;t do with their brilliant Ver. 10 of Microsoft Outlook. The situation usually gets unnoticed until you start getting those emails with quotes from a Linux guy and you find yourself incapable of &amp;ldquo;responding&amp;rdquo; with the similar cream-at-the-bottom. That was yesterday, however. The Outlook Quote is the cool answer to the quest and it does it all and more. It has very elegant user interface, extensibility, ease of use, ease of installation and complete seamless integration with Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to maintain several source branches in SourceSafe and constantly retrofitting your code around, this application can be tremendously helpful. It looks in to two specified SourceSafe folders, goes through all the files in them and finds out which files are different and performs various analysis in smarter way so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually check diffs manually.

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me you would be maintaining backups of things ranging from your favorite links to ICQ logs on writable CDs. But there is a snag. There would be lots of files on your disk that has names more then 60 characters - like the .lnk file in your Favorite folder! And that crashes the CD writing process regularly because normal CD file system doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow longer names. Solution? Sorten it! With this utility! This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You might have to modify the source code for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual to see &amp;ldquo;Missing References&amp;rdquo; when you open the VB project and then take the pain of correcting them by hand. If it has became your daily routine and you are really tired of that, here&amp;rsquo;s the magic VB Add-In that will save you from that! This add-in monitors the state of references when you open the VB project. If it&amp;rsquo;s Missing or not proper, it will look in to VBP file and try to locate the DLL and correct that bad reference for you! Besides everything else, it shows how to write self-installing VB Add-In and some cool add-in techniques. If you said WOW, head on for download!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most wanted feature from users point of view in MS SQL Server is capability to generate INSERT scripts for MS SQL Server data. But call it Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s ignorance, this feature not supplied since quite long. And even worse, there is no public domain application to do that. This feature is usually desperately required in situation like sending test data to somebody or supply sample data. So I decided to write my own. It&amp;rsquo;s still isn&amp;rsquo;t the perfect and can&amp;rsquo;t handle all of the possibilities but it could be your best bet with supplied source code! This application is right now in state of easy installation but no on-line help is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Windows network with NT Server in your organization, you have now ability to send messages to users that will popup on their screens all of the sudden. This is similar to how you get the message box on the screen when printer completes the printing. Administrators can use this app to send message to users asking them to log out. Or may be you just want to ask a colleague to come for a coffee! This application is right now in state of easy clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This application scans the given folder and sub folders for VBP files, analyses which VBP file references which ones and generates a Tree view showing this relationships. What&amp;rsquo;s more, it stores this analysis results in Access database so that you can run your own query or open it at later time. This utility is typically useful if your project consists of tons of VB components calling each other and if you wish to see what will be the impact of changing interface of one on other components. You can also use it to just document component relationships between your projects. This application also shows you how to analyze VBP file contents and ready-to-use source code.

&lt;p&gt;This is a little program to search for particular words in files in particular folder. Windows Find feature does search for a particular string in files but you can&amp;rsquo;t search for Word1 AND Word2 AND Word3. This program does just that. I made this program mainly to search for specific piece of code from 1000s of VB source code samples stored on my hard drive.

&lt;p&gt;Visual Music lets you play 128 musical instruments on your PC including Flute, Bagpiper and even whistle! You can even record what you are playing, edit it and save it in a file. If you not expert at playing synthesiser keyboard, it provides you a easy to use scripting language to create music just by telling what key in which instrument you want to play for how much time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concept of trojan horses is not new. Programs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shitalshah.com/www.bo2k.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Back Orifice 2000&lt;/a&gt; silently stays in background in your PC, acts as TCP/IP server and allows somebody to connect it through Internet and execute commands sent by them. The REA2 (Remote Execution Agent) is my own trojan horse specifically designed for silent, full proof, reliable and powerfull intrusion and control. I crafted this gem in about 5 hours and comparing with BO2K, it lacks few features like real time screen display and mouse control and plug-ins but it&amp;rsquo;s designed to be much more &amp;ldquo;reliable and silent intrusion&amp;rdquo; and has some more capabilities then BO2K. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Delphi 3.0 to eliminate any runtime requirements. The EXE available here is a server. You can use any client that can connect to it on port 23145 and send the command as strings. My favorite client is my own PortTalk. I didn&amp;rsquo;t got much time to document these stuff (as usual it was fun program solely meant for me) but you can get the list of commands in TMainForm.ProcessReq function in main.pas file. This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You might have to modify the source code for your needs. However you may freely contact me for the assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

I used this program to learn how exactly browser makes request for a page to HTTP server or how other TCP/IP protocols like Ping and Time works. I started out my TCP/IP programming journey by reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rfc-editor.org/&#34; title=&#34;Request For Comment Documents By Internet Engineering Task Force&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RFCs&lt;/a&gt; on different protocols and actually experimenting with them using PortTalk. I&amp;rsquo;d made even my own HTTP server and utilities like PortTalk were indispensible while testing them. The advanced version allows you to connect to to REA2 server (see below) and do a file transfer. This application is right now in state of easy clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
