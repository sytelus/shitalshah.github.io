As it takes you longer to make your changes, there is a greater chance that your local repo might already be out of date as other people have pushed their changes. In this setting, you don’t want to make your changes directly in master because otherwise you might end up creating large merge commits which makes your repo’s history convoluted and not very nice.\nHere’s the better git workflow you might want to use in any team of size \u0026gt; 1.\nBefore you make changes, create a branch.\ngit checkout -b MyFeature Next make changes, do commits as usual.\nIf you don’t want to rely on your hard drive, you can also keep pushing the changes in your branch on the server every once in a while,\ngit push -u origin MyFeature Once you are done with all your changes, first you want to rebase your branch to master. If master has no new changes since you had created your branch, this will be essentially be no-op. But otherwise, git will take all your commits and play them back on the top of master. This way your commits will look like as if they happened on latest version of master instead of the version you branched out from. This will make commit history of your repo clean and easy to reason about. If you were the only developer, this might not be very important but if there is more than just you then it makes easy to see for other people changes every one is making.\nTo do rebase, first get latest master.\ngit checkout master git pull origin master Then go back to your branch and rebase, i.e.,\ngit checkout Myfeature git rebase master If you are lucky, you won’t see the word “conflict” in git messages but otherwise there is more work for you! If someone already changed file sections you have also changed then you might see list of conflicts. If you get lost in too many messages, use this command to see pending conflicts:\ngit diff --name-only --diff-filter=U Now about resolving conflicts… there are lots of tools out there and most unfortunately have some problem/confusion installing or using. If you absolutely want GUI tool, install DiffMerge, make sure its in your path and invoke it like,\ngit mergetool -t diffmerge . However my preferred method is to simply open up conflicted file in editor, search for “»\u0026gt;” and review sections that looks like:\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; HEAD This is change in master ======= This is change in your branch \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; branch-a Now keep the change you want, delete the markers and you are done with that conflict. Another shortcut is to just tell git to take master’s version (“ours”) or your branch’s version(“theirs”). For example, to resolve all conflicts by overriding using your changes:\ngit checkout . --theirs Another tricky conflict is when file gets deleted by one person and simultaneously changed by you or vice versa. In this case, git will put a deleted file back in your repo and you have to decide either keep that one and/or remove/update your version. You won’t have markers this time like above. I tend to use tool like Beyond Compare to compare two files and make edits as needed.\nTo tell git that you have resolved all conflict,\ngit add . Now you can continue with your rebase,\ngit rebase --continue If you don’t want to continue because of whatever reason,\ngit rebase --abort Sometime git might error out while doing continue because there is nothing to commit (may be it detected that the change already exists upstream). In that case you can do,\ngit rebase --skip At this point, your changes are now on the top of latest master. You can verify this by looking at quick history of latest 10 commits,\ngit log --pretty=oneline -n 10 Note that everything still reside in your own branch. If you are not yet ready to push to master, keep working in your branch doing more commits as you go. After rebase if you want to save your branch on server, you must do –force because you are rewriting history.\ngit push --force origin Myfeature This is perfectly fine as long as you are the only one working on the branch.\nOnce you are ready to push, first merge your branch with master,\ngit checkout master git merge --squash MyFeature This shouldn’t give any errors or conflict messages because your branch was already synced up to latest master. The –squash tells git to combine all your commit in to single commit. This is good idea most of the time if you have done lots of commits like “added forgotten file”, “fixed minor typo” and so on. It’s too much noise and not nice to other people for having to scroll through tons of minor commits to figure out your higher level goals. However its also ok if you don’t want –squash option.\nFinally do the commit after the merge,\ngit commit -m \u0026#34;MyFeature does X\u0026#34; If you did –squash above then you will see only one commit in your history at the top of previous commits with above message.\nAt this point, you can decide to push your changes to master OR move your changes to new branch and keep working. …","date":1488100603,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488100603,"objectID":"9dde8c29903511f17e1a0643caf85e27","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/git-workflow-branch-rebase-squash-merge/","publishdate":"2017-02-26T09:16:43Z","relpermalink":"/p/git-workflow-branch-rebase-squash-merge/","section":"post","summary":"So you want to make a change to your git repo while other people may also be simultaneously working on the same repo.

It can be done like,\ntemplate\u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; void append(Vector\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026amp; to, const Vector\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026amp; from) { to.insert(to.end(), from.begin(), from.end()); } One problem with this approach is that we can only use this function with Vector. So what about all other container types? In languages such as C#, we have IEnumerable that simplifies lot of things but with C++ templates are duck typed and it takes bit more to make above function generic for various container types. Another quick and dirty route is this:\ntemplate\u0026lt;typename Container\u0026gt; void append(Container\u0026amp; to, const Container\u0026amp; from) { to.insert(to.end(), from.begin(), from.end()); } The problem with this approach is that any class with begin() and end() will now qualify for this call. In fact, just in case someone has class with these methods which actually isn’t implemented as iterator, you can get some nasty surprises. A simple modification is to make sure we call begin() and end() from std namespace instead of the ones defined on class:\ntemplate\u0026lt;typename Container\u0026gt; void append(Container\u0026amp; to, const Container\u0026amp; from) { using std::begin; using std::end; to.insert(end(to), begin(from), end(from)); } Sure, this is better but wouldn’t it be nice if can we restrict the types passed on to this function to only those which strictly behaves like STL containers? Enter type traits! First, we need to define SFINAE type trait for containers. Fortunately Louis Delacroix who developed prettyprint library has already fine tuned this code extensively. Below is mostly his code with a my slight modification that allows to pass it through GCC strict mode compilation. This is lot of code so I would usually put this in a separate file, say, type_utils.hpp, so you can use it for many generic container methods:\n#ifndef commn_utils_type_utils_hpp #define commn_utils_type_utils_hpp #include \u0026lt;type_traits\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;valarray\u0026gt; namespace common_utils { namespace type_utils { //from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louisdx/cxx-prettyprint/master/prettyprint.hpp //also see https://gist.github.com/louisdx/1076849 namespace detail { // SFINAE type trait to detect whether T::const_iterator exists. struct sfinae_base { using yes = char; using no = yes[2]; }; template \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; struct has_const_iterator : private sfinae_base { private: template \u0026lt;typename C\u0026gt; static yes \u0026amp; test(typename C::const_iterator*); template \u0026lt;typename C\u0026gt; static no \u0026amp; test(...); public: static const bool value = sizeof(test\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(nullptr)) == sizeof(yes); using type = T; void dummy(); //for GCC to supress -Wctor-dtor-privacy }; template \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; struct has_begin_end : private sfinae_base { private: template \u0026lt;typename C\u0026gt; static yes \u0026amp; f(typename std::enable_if\u0026lt; std::is_same\u0026lt;decltype(static_cast\u0026lt;typename C::const_iterator(C::*)() const\u0026gt;(\u0026amp;C::begin)), typename C::const_iterator(C::*)() const\u0026gt;::value\u0026gt;::type *); template \u0026lt;typename C\u0026gt; static no \u0026amp; f(...); template \u0026lt;typename C\u0026gt; static yes \u0026amp; g(typename std::enable_if\u0026lt; std::is_same\u0026lt;decltype(static_cast\u0026lt;typename C::const_iterator(C::*)() const\u0026gt;(\u0026amp;C::end)), typename C::const_iterator(C::*)() const\u0026gt;::value, void\u0026gt;::type*); template \u0026lt;typename C\u0026gt; static no \u0026amp; g(...); public: static bool const beg_value = sizeof(f\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(nullptr)) == sizeof(yes); static bool const end_value = sizeof(g\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(nullptr)) == sizeof(yes); void dummy(); //for GCC to supress -Wctor-dtor-privacy }; } // namespace detail // Basic is_container template; specialize to derive from std::true_type for all desired container types template \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; struct is_container : public std::integral_constant\u0026lt;bool, detail::has_const_iterator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;::value \u0026amp;\u0026amp; detail::has_begin_end\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;::beg_value \u0026amp;\u0026amp; detail::has_begin_end\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;::end_value\u0026gt; { }; template \u0026lt;typename T, std::size_t N\u0026gt; struct is_container\u0026lt;T[N]\u0026gt; : std::true_type { }; template \u0026lt;std::size_t N\u0026gt; struct is_container\u0026lt;char[N]\u0026gt; : std::false_type { }; template \u0026lt;typename T\u0026gt; struct is_container\u0026lt;std::valarray\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026gt; : std::true_type { }; template \u0026lt;typename T1, typename T2\u0026gt; struct is_container\u0026lt;std::pair\u0026lt;T1, T2\u0026gt;\u0026gt; : std::true_type { }; template \u0026lt;typename ...Args\u0026gt; struct is_container\u0026lt;std::tuple\u0026lt;Args...\u0026gt;\u0026gt; : std::true_type { }; }}\t//namespace #endif Much better!\n","date":1465118678,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465118678,"objectID":"d787af85e3d4de5fb131af9d3c283687","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/writing-generic-container-function-in-c11/","publishdate":"2016-06-05T09:24:38Z","relpermalink":"/p/writing-generic-container-function-in-c11/","section":"post","summary":"Let’s say we want to write function to append one vector to another.

So here are the full steps that works for Ubuntu 14 for mounting Windows network file share on Ubuntu through active directory domain account:\nFirst you need to install cifs-utils. Check if you already have it:\ndpkg -l cifs-utils If not, just install it:\nsudo apt-get install cifs-utils You can mount Windows shares anywhere but /mnt is generally preferred. Another often used location is /media but in modern environments /mnt is more preferred for things that users mount manually while /media is more preferred for things that system would mount for you. Regardless, you should create a folder where the content of your share will appear. Run following command to do that:\nNote: In this guide, replace ALL_CAPS words with values you want.\nmkdir -p /mnt/FOLDER Then run the mount command:\nsudo mount -t cifs //SERVER/FOLDER /mnt/FOLDER -o username=USER,domain=DOMAIN,iocharset=utf8 Note that,\nWe set iocharset to utf8. This is optional but better than default charset ISO 8859-1 that Linux uses for mount. Some websites uses filemod/dirmode to 777 (i.e. grant all permissions). This is usually not necessary. That’s it! If you need to unmount share then run the command, sudo umount //SERVER/FOLDER One problem is that, you will need to run mount command every time after you restart again. While there are ways to connect network shares at startup, they often involve storing your passwords and not recommended. So usually I would just add a line in my ~/.bash-aliases file like this:\ralias mountshare=\u0026#39;sudo mount -t cifs //SERVER/FOLDER /mnt/FOLDER -o username=USER,domain=DOMAIN,iocharset=utf8\u0026#39; So next time when I need share, I just type `mountshare` on command line.

Enabling this lets compiler warn you about any potential issues that might often get unnoticed in build noise. Unfortunately there is little documentation, let alone quick tutorial on this subject so I thought to write this up.\nFirst, let’s clear this up: There is no official GCC mode called “strict”. I just made that term up. Fortunately there are enough compiler options that you can rig up to create “strict” mode that is often available in many other languages.\nTo get the “strict” mode, I use following command line options for gcc/g++. Below are written in format consumable in CMakeList.txt but you can use same options from pretty much anywhere.\nset(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \u0026#34;-std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Wstrict-aliasing -pedantic -fmax-errors=5 -Werror -Wunreachable-code -Wcast-align -Wcast-qual -Wctor-dtor-privacy -Wdisabled-optimization -Wformat=2 -Winit-self -Wlogical-op -Wmissing-include-dirs -Wnoexcept -Wold-style-cast -Woverloaded-virtual -Wredundant-decls -Wshadow -Wsign-promo -Wstrict-null-sentinel -Wstrict-overflow=5 -Wswitch-default -Wundef -Wno-unused -Wno-variadic-macros -Wno-parentheses -fdiagnostics-show-option ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}\u0026#34;) That’s a looong list of compiler options so now I hope you can agree that we really mean “strict” business here :). In essence it enables extra warnings and makes all warnings as errors, points out coding issues that borderlines on pedantic and then on top of that enables some more warnings. Rest assured, above is not an overkill. You are going to thank compiler for taking care of these stuff as your code base becomes larger and more complex.\nUnfortunately, road from here has lots of twist and turns. The first thing that might happen to you is that you will get tons of errors, most likely not from your own code but from the included headers that you don’t own! Because of the way C++ works, other people’s bad code in their included header becomes your liability. Except for Boost and standard library, I haven’t found many packages that can get through strict mode compilation. Even for relatively nicely written packages such as ROS you will get tons of compiler errors and for badly written packages such as DJI SDK, forget about it. Right… So now what?\nHere’s the fix I have used with fair amount of success. First, declare these two macros in some common utility file you have in your project:\n#define STRICT_MODE_OFF \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic push\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wreturn-type\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wunused-parameter\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-pedantic\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wshadow\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wold-style-cast\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wswitch-default\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) /* Addition options that can be enabled _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wpedantic\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wformat=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Werror\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Werror=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \\\u0026#34;-Wunused-variable\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) \\ */ #define STRICT_MODE_ON \\ _Pragma(\u0026#34;GCC diagnostic pop\u0026#34;) Here we have two macros, one tells GCC to turn off selected warnings before some chunk of code and second tells GCC to re-enable it. Why can’t we just turn off all strict mode warnings at once? Because GCC currently doesn’t have that option. You must list every individual warning :(. Above list is something I just put together while dealing with ROS and DJI SDK and is obviously incomplete. Your project might encounter more stuff in which case you will need to keep adding in to above list. Another issue you might encounter is that GCC currently doesn’t support suppressing every possible warnings! Yes, a big oops there. One of them that I recently encountered in DJI SDK was this:\nwarning: ISO C99 requires rest arguments to be used The only way out for me in this case was to modify DJI’s source code and submit the issue to them so hopefully they will fix it in next release.\nOnce you have above macros, you can place them around problematic headers. For example,\n#include \u0026lt;string\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;vector\u0026gt; STRICT_MODE_OFF #include \u0026lt;ros/ros.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;actionlib/server/simple_action_server.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;dji_sdk/dji_drone.h\u0026gt; STRICT_MODE_ON #include \u0026#34;mystuff.hpp\u0026#34; We are not out of the water yet because above trick will work only for some header files. The reason is that GCC sometime doesn’t compile entire file as soon as it encounters #include statement. So it’s pointless to put macros around those #include statements. Solving those issues requires some more work, and in some cases a lot more work. The trick I used was to create wrappers around things you use from bad headers such that only those wrappers needs to use #include \u0026lt;BadStuff.h\u0026gt; statements and rest of your code doesn’t need those header. Then you can disable strict …","date":1464052791,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464052791,"objectID":"5e374656e95d92e8a94a0f791d3de20a","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/how-to-enable-and-use-gcc-strict-mode-compilation/","publishdate":"2016-05-24T01:19:51Z","relpermalink":"/p/how-to-enable-and-use-gcc-strict-mode-compilation/","section":"post","summary":"One of the great feature that many C++ programmers rarely use is GCC strict mode compilation.

So instead of writing my detailed trip report I thought about all the mistakes I’d made and converting them to tips. Here it goes…\nSun shelter (things that look like REI Alcove) is absolutely essential if you just have a camping tent. I would however not recommend REI Alcove itself because it broke after withstanding 3 days of sandstorms. Obviously you also need nice camping chair to go with it. Regular tent stacks are not very useful to secure tents on playa. I didn’t believed that and my tent almost came out in sandstorms. The correct way to secure tent in playa is using something called “rebars”. You need 4 rebars for a regular camping tent, each 3” long and 1/2” wide. You need another 4 or 6 for sun shelter. Stores like Home Depot would cut the metal rod for you in these sizes. Of course, you will need big hammer as well to stack them (they don’t have pointy end). Finally, it’s a hazard to leave other end of these rusty metal rods open so you must stick a tennis ball or empty bottles on end of the rod that is sticking out. Sandstorms! In 2009 there were 3 full days of sandstorms. If you never seen one then here’s how it works: About 20-60 foot tall wall of sand that comes at you at anywhere between 10 miles to 40 miles an hour. The visibility typically drops to 5ft to 50ft and you see brownish sand everywhere around you. This can last for up to 8 hours straight. It actually looks cool and as a matter of fact I intentionally spent lots of time inside sandstorm taking photos (note: Many SLRs are not dust proof). Even on severe storm days almost everyone continued their activities as if it was normal weather. But they were prepared. Here’s what you need to be prepared:\nYou have to have sun glasses with minimum open space around lenses. I had Tifosi Ventoux and they worked kind of OK. A retainer is also essential not to loose them (remember there are no shops to buy extra pair). Mask for the nose and mouth. I used Buff bandana so I can pull it up all the way to sunglasses. Next time I would also be using this, this or this mask so I can be absolutely worry free about staying longer out in dust storms. Hat with cord and visor. This will allow you to walk heads down while visor protects your face. I used this hat and it’s absolutely the best hat I’ve ever owned. Added advantage of this hat is that it’s veil can be put in the direction of wind. As a first timer I found that 4 nights provides a very good breadth and depth for the experience. The reason it’s perfect is because you have to carry less food and water, not worry too much about getting shower and you still get to see nearly everything that’s out there. I would strongly recommend against staying less than 3 nights. Make a stop at Reno at least for a night before heading towards Black Rock City. Besides mini-Las Vegas style environment, you can also visit REI, Walmart and Walgreens to get the gear, water, grocery and so on. Pepermill Resort is where I stayed overnight because it’s cheapest awesome hotel in Reno. A compass is very useful to have to get on the right street when coming back in the night far away from playa. If you have 3-season camping tent you are probably in trouble. These tents usually have mesh in the walls for ventilation and they have rain fly to protect against rain. This arrangement however is pretty useless to protect against sandstorms. On a typical stormy day I would get about half inch layer of sand inside my 3 season tent and I had to spend an hour every night cleaning things up. Make sure you have duct tapes and things to cover up. Everything outside tent should be tied to rebars so it doesn’t fly away with storms. Weather at burning man is 110F+. It’s normally not possible to sleep inside the tent after 10 AM. It’s not unusual to stay up until 3 AM. Nights are cold and you will need a fleece jacket. I’d 30 degree rated bag which was bit warmer but worked fine. BTW, try to bring sleeping bag liner to avoid it getting sweaty. As a first timer it might be hard to understand culture of gifts. For example, someone I don’t know at all would give me something and I would be confused if I should really take it. This can spoil the experience for the giver and the taker. Here’s how it works: If someone gives you a gift, take it with a smile without hesitation and give them a gift in return. It’s that simple. The only thing to remember is to bring bunch of gifts that you can easily carry around. Here are some of the examples of gifts: Custom stickers with your favorite quotes, necklaces, bead jewelry, things that glows, Trillion Dollars Notes, candies, custom printed postcards and so on. A single major mistake first timers make is not to bring gifts to give away. Bicycles would be your savior. If you can’t bring from home then rent or steal from Reno. BRC is really huge and you would be lucky if you could walk just one street a day.

So when I saw this deal from Southwest about 50% off on all travels my first thought was to book tickets to Las Vegas (nearest to Zion) or SLC. Due to restriction on this deal the travel needs to be completed by May 31st.\nSo the question: Is last week of May the best time to do Zion Narrows? I’ve fanatically looked for answer all over and here’s the summary. Disclaimer: that I haven’t been there so all these research comes from web, not my experience.\nMy criteria for “best time” is fairly simple:\nAvoid wearing dry/wet suit to do this hike Avoid wading in 1ft of water for miles Pleasant 70s temperature that allows good other hikes like Angel’s Landing Several websites have various opinions on “best time”. A top Google hit puts up a table indicating May, June and Septembers are the best. This is way too fuzzy answer because early May is actually as worse as April and it doesn’t tell you different late May really is compared to late June. Yes, there is a big difference!\nNext, other websites gets more specific and tells you late June and late September is the best time. We are getting closer to a specific answer but still no data points.\nAfter lot of searching I finally hit the pot of gold:USGA Water Data! This website has exact numbers for CFS (cubic foot per second) and gage height data for each day all the way back to 1988. The rules are quite simple: anything below 50 CFS is easy and 250 FS is too much. The USGA has done fantastic job in presenting this data on website. For example, here you can see CFS levels for 2008:\nNow you can see late May is not all that good but it is rapidly getting better over entire June although it takes all of the June before we get 40 CFS. This means late June is pretty good time to go but difference between early June and late June is almost two fold! Then notice all those spikes in early July. My guess is those are flash floods or thunderstorms. On other hand look how stable mid-end September is! We get 30 CFS almost all month.\nSo we are looking at about foot of water at May end and about quarter of that in mid-end September.\nLikewise you can go through charts for may years back. It obviously varies from year to year. For example, year 2007 had very low stable CFS at end of May unlike rapidly decreasing high levels of 2008.\nFor the past few years worth of charts that I checked one theme emerges: mid to end September has most stable and low CFS!\nBut how about temperatures? Here’s where Weather Underground’s seasonal average feature helps! Here is the seasonal averages weather graph for Zion National Park:\nAs you can see, the temperature in mid-September is pleasant 70s just like in June.\nSo there you have it! Mid September to September end (2nd and 3rd weeks of September) is the best time to go to Zion National Park and Narrows. That’s when you are most likely to get stable low water levels.\n","date":1232712840,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1232712840,"objectID":"d03d7a51999dca4cee3cf4fa4e2e73c0","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/what-is-the-best-time-to-hike-zion-narrows/","publishdate":"2009-01-23T12:14:00Z","relpermalink":"/p/what-is-the-best-time-to-hike-zion-narrows/","section":"post","summary":"I LOVE slot canyons and Zion Narrows hike is something on my To-do for very long time since I saw it in a documentary and IMAX.

This is my current absolute favorite subject to spend all my free time so I HAD to be there. The talk also turned out to be very energetic, fun and fast paced by Jennifer Mangels of Columbia University. The first part of the talk was about the role of the hippocampus in forming long term memories and her research. What they tried to do was to record EEG signals from different areas of the neocortex when a person tries to memorize something and recall it back later. Her research attempts to imperially prove that different areas of the brain must strongly participate together to have hippocampus realize the importance of the incoming information and form the contextual long term memories. While I really disgust at how everyone in neuroscience these days just do some EEGs and fMRIs and run around to write conclusions, above theory fits well with Jeff Hawkin’s On Intelligence.\nHowever more interesting was the second part of the talk: The Self Theory of Intelligence. This is very interesting. In 1970s, Carol Dweck did some research on human motivation in school children and noted that some students intrinsically tend to persist in the face of failure while others quit as soon as the going gets rough. After more investigations, she discovered that student’s beliefs about the nature of intelligence had a strong connection with the way they approach challenging intellectual tasks: Students who view their intelligence as an unchangeable internal characteristic tend to shy away from academic challenges, whereas students who believe that their intelligence can be increased through effort and persistence seek them out.\nStudents who hold an “entity” theory of intelligence agree with statements such as “Your intelligence is something about you that you can’t change very much.” Since they believe their intelligence is fixed, these students place high value on success. They worry that failure-or even having to work very hard at something-will be perceived as evidence of their low intelligence. Therefore, they make academic choices that maximize the possibility that they will perform well. For example, a student may opt to take a lower-level course because it will be easier to earn an A. In contrast, students who have an “incremental” theory of intelligence are not threatened by failure. Because they believe that their intelligence can be increased through effort and persistence, these students set mastery goals and seek academic challenges that they believe will help them to grow intellectually (Dweck, 1999b).\nDr. Dweck’s research on the impact of praise suggests that many teachers and parents may be unwittingly leading students to accept an entity view of intelligence. By praising students for their intelligence, rather than effort, many adults are sending the message that success and failure depend on something beyond the students’ control. Comments such as “You got a great score on your math test, Jimmy! You are such a smart boy!” are interpreted by students as “If success means that I am smart, then failure must mean that I am dumb.” When these students perform well they have high self-esteem, but this crashes as soon as they hit an academic stumbling block. Students who are praised for their effort are much more likely to view intelligence as being malleable, and their self-esteem remains stable regardless of how hard they may have to work to succeed at a task.

I got to watch them in sequence for the first time and it made lot of sense and gave me a new perspective about this whole “religion”. Some observations…\nFirst StarWars wasn’t really advertised as Episode IV. That tag came later. After watching first StarWars anyone could see that Princes Liea and Luke were going to be a couple. All indications are that, Lucas changed his intentions for V and VI for God knows why. From the story point of view, IV remains the coolest. The V is a head twisting story and VI looks like a patch work to justify what V did. This is, of course, not to mean that these movies aren’t still some of the coolest. Lucas didn’t asked for more compensation for making first StarWars but instead rights to make sequel. He took the loan from the bank and made the sequels from his own money. This is strikingly unusual and highlight of the confidence on what he believed in (especially when sequels are such a huge gamble that no one in the industry invests their own money to make them). Before I watched the marathon, my impression for Lucas was a person who knew how to maximize cash from popularity. While this hasn’t changed much, I’ve gained new appreciation for him. “I’m your father” was a last minute story edit. Even the director who was hired by Lucas to make V wasn’t aware of it. It seems that Lucas who had been buried under big lone from the bank, severe over budgeting and schedule slippage decided to use typical tactics of putting a huge “surprise” that would make people wanna come for the sequel. The biggest asset of StarWars is probably the background musical score. Initial edits of first StarWars without this musical score looks like a B grade sci-fi. Times has published a long article about StarWars apparently with tons of praise for Lucas and without a single critic for Episode I and II which universally believed to be “sucked”. You can tell Lucas has hired some really deep reach PR firm :). The Gold pack is the re-released (digitally retouched) version of the movies which means it looks really cool and young. My wife pointed out that at the end of the Episode VI when Luke sees his father along with Yoda and Obi-Van, the original actor has been digitally replaced with the one who appears in I \u0026amp; II! Obviously, Lucas hadn’t planned it all along 🙂 ","date":1115732950,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1115732950,"objectID":"364cbab908c1b3507336b732a9e8e033","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/starwars-weekend-marathon-2005/","publishdate":"2005-05-10T13:49:10Z","relpermalink":"/p/starwars-weekend-marathon-2005/","section":"post","summary":"We planned back-to-back original StarWars trilogy marathon over the weekend.

This is the car we bought in year 2004. I’ve heard that the 2005 model is exactly the same but I haven’t checked it. Anyway lets start the engines!\nThis car is a real head turner. I mean REAL. People see BMWs and Mercedes SLK350 and go ahh. This car is beyond that. Here, people not just go ahh but they literally stop you, tell you that they just went ahh and ask details about the car. And by “people” I mean complete strangers of all age and all types (even those truck and SUVs fans). It’s not unusual for us to get one such stranger encounter every other week. RX-8 has got automatic plus semi manual shifting called “sport” mode. In sport mode, you can shift gears right on the steering wheel! Also this mode is safe even if you tend to screw up when driving manual. This is a rear wheel drive and that means it really sucks on the snow. Actually it sucks more than average rear wheel drives. The semi-manual shifting doesn’t help in snow because it looks like the automatic vehicle stability controls is turned off when you switch to manual so it’s even more dangerous to manual on snow. When it was snowing heavily for couple of days, I preferred to park my car in parking lot and take the train. It’s little more above then ground (with those big tires, of course) then most sports car. This helps a lot when you on dirty-rocky road. However you may not cross lanes by going over divider lines like those SUVs do. On the plus side, it doesn’t flip over like those SUVs do. This car has rotary engines, not cylinders. So terms like V4, V6 doesn’t apply to it. It simply doesn’t have any pistons. It’s fun to explain this to people when their first question for sports cars is “oh, is that V8?”. The coolest feature that might get peoples jaw dropped for this car is suicide doors. They are extremely cool. We have seen car passing us by and then backing up to us asking “what is that?”. It’s even more fun when you try to get insurance for this car. “How many doors it has?” the agent might ask. It’s technically neither 2 door or 4 door! This car defies the common mold. Many reviews I’d read said the trunk space is small. So far we didn’t had problems putting our stuff including telescope, guest luggage, caving gear and what not. If you frequently go outdoor places, GPS is not optional. In early 2004 model, the factory installed GPS had really bad software so we didn’t took it and bought after market Garmin. However Mazda has upgraded this software in December, 2004 and it’s as good as any after market GPS. I believe GPS is probably the most important thing in the car after steering wheel, gas and breaks. RX-8 has cool design for in-between seat space. You get two cup holders in front and back, 3 big storage compartments, and two cigarette lighters. Totally worth it. You want the red one. The seat design and covers has star trekee looks. The covers are made from washable and really wear resistant special material. This means you can put heavy stuff like big luggage bags with pointy corners on the seats without worry. This car is a huge gas guzzler. I guess it consumes at least 30% more gas then typical 4 door cars of similar size. We need to refill typically after every 5 hours of drive. And just so you know, this car only likes to have 93 octane premium gas. On another luxury preferences of this car, you can only tow it on a flat bed. Other towing may damage the car. RX-8 has powerful big breaks. Infect its breaks have same specs as Porsche Carrera GT. You might also notice that tires do not have wheel covers allowing faster cooling of those big breaks. The bad part is that lots of rust gets in to those parts and sometime it looks awful. However Mazda engineers have let us know that this is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about. R8-8 dimensions are very similar to Porsche Carrera GT. There are no rear wipers. So far I’ve took it to 110 mph (higher speed isn’t easy in tri-state area). High speed is pretty natural to this car. RX-8 has rotary engines and it makes unique pleasant sound then engine with cylinders. The main advantage seems to be their super compact size and disadvantage being they are gas guzzlers. Apparently only Mazda makes cars with rotary engines. They had released RX-7 about 8 years ago and the RX-8 is new incarnation with more compact and efficient engines. Check out RX-8 club which has tons of rotary engine fans. It has almost enough head rooms for 6 ft people. It has dumb headlights - totally manual, no photo sensors. It doesn’t have dumb doors (the ones you need to slam hard couple of times to get them shut). This car requires mirrors to be perfectly set to avoid blind spots. It’s more important than other cars. That means, if you are a couple, you both should be of nearly equal height people so if you switch seats, you don’t have to reset the whole thing again.

Few years ago, you only had to deal with idiotic Ticketmaster and now the pain is extended to 100s of brokers that have mushroomed to somehow “lawfully” buying off all the nicest seats and later sells it with the price tag of 2X or more. No wonder shows like Wicked and Lion King are now suddenly sold out for next 8 months or so. These guys even have their “national association” and just makes me wonder what they did to the system so as to make their whole thing a perfectly “legal business”.\nThis entire anomaly could be blamed on this worst ticketing website of the World. Not only they charge “convenience fee” of $5 per ticket for using their annoying website but unlike anything else on the Net, they have absolutely no returns policy!

However if you are after those popular shows, don’t rely on “manual” bidding. It doesn’t work. You may quickly realize that most bids on such auctions occur in the last 60 seconds of auction (known as “bidding war”). The bid prices literally go twice for these tickets during the last few seconds. This is courtesy of the automated programs (robots) called snipers which bids on your behalf in last few seconds before the auction closes. The one web-based sniper that I used and which reliably worked was eSnipe. But there are tons of others out there. Other place to look out is Craig’s list and stub hub, especially if you wanted to sell your tickets at the last moment.\nOverall, let’s all continue to hate and investigate how Ticketmaster manages to stay alive (and use that knowledge to kill it one day).\n","date":1112027642,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1112027642,"objectID":"d3a04fba35fecab4d541f78752cd812d","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/buying-and-selling-broadway-show-tickets-2005/","publishdate":"2005-03-28T16:34:02Z","relpermalink":"/p/buying-and-selling-broadway-show-tickets-2005/","section":"post","summary":"When it comes to buy Broadway show tickets these days, scene is really the worse.

Short review: It rocks and totally worth it (especially playing PS2 games wired with 5.1 sound system and WinAmp Visualizers on a big screen). And here are more tidbits for you geeks:\nDell 2300MP is new line of DLP projector which (I guess) came out in Oct 2004. It has whooping 2300 lumens and 2100 contrast ratio and cost me $1165 including shipping. It’s native resolution is 1024X768 which exceeds many plasmas. Projector of this class used to cost almost twice a year ago. PS2 even with S-Video connector gives pretty cool quality. Through 5.1 surround sound system with games like Grand Theft Auto and you can hear cars passing by around you as if you are on real road. This projector doesn’t have DVI connector (for digital video from PCs) and component video/RGB connection (for high resolution DVD movies or 1080i HDTV format). That means you can only go as good as S-Vide. Also it has only one S-Video port. I don’t think this is a huge disadvantage because more resolution offered by these connectors can’t be displayed by projector anyway. It comes with lots of wires (though short in length) and a slick case. Remember projector wiring and screen is a significant portion of total projector cost. A 25ft VGA cable alone can cost easily over $50. One big limitation of most projection system is that you can project only a specific size picture from specific distance. So say if you have have 85\u0026#34; diagonal area available project on be able place projector at around 10-12 ft from the wall. No more no less. And yes, you must buy enough long wires to hook up all your PS2s, cable TVs and PCs. This projector is super bright and it looks terrific even on our direct white wall projection without using any screen at all. It’s so bright that we don’t even feel needed to turn off our lights. On the daytime, if you have really bright room (no curtains on big glass wall), picture would appear washed out – not good enough for DVD quality but still pretty good for talk shows like quality. Because of high lumens and contrast, the most suitable screens for this projector are matt white screens with the gain 1.0 or even lower. This eliminated need for high gain screens means you get wide viewing angle just like usual TV set and uncompromising colors. Many people complained about circular “rainbows” that appears when watching B\u0026amp;W movies. It doesn’t seem to appear so far with us but I guess it might popup if you are watching high contrast black and white movie for a long time. Because of high contrast, darker scenes in the movie would feel darker. You will need to mess around with settings for this for a while (Dogma=3 works for us pretty well). BTW, we run at only 40% of its maximum brightness. When projector is not placed right at the center of screen but on lower or upper side. You get a distortion called keystone. This projector has built-in key-stone elimination feature which works great but it doesn’t have any way to shrink picture horizontally or vertically or compensate for horizontal center-off alignment. If you are planning to project on for more than 100\u0026#34;, you should consider exact center ceiling mount. If you still don’t think projector is a best bet for a screen, do a math on movie tickets. And even then if you don’t get convinced, go watch Step into liquid on 85\u0026#34; screen projected by this little toy! It’s brilliant!

I would highly recommend services like Rhapsody if you want to explore these. What’s more important is the way they provide navigation and ability to discover more.

It appears that this is definitely the next generation of music quality but there is very little or no information on many of its aspects. Here I’ll try to summarize what I found so far:\nThis format is capable of delivering very high quality multi-channel surround sound on your home theater system. The DVD-A format is entirely different than usual Dolby Digital or DTS which is used for DVD movies. The quality that could be delivered using DVD-A is superior than Dolby Digital or DTS. If you look in to your DVD disk in Windows Explorer, you will find that there are two folders: Audio_TS and Video_TS. So far, only Video_TS folder was used to put all the movie files on DVDs because industry wasn’t settled on standards for DVD-A format. Recently standards have been finalized and loads of new music albums are now being released in this format. They have content inside Audio_TS folder which contains DVD-A audio tracks in files with extension .aob. Because its brand new format, you need newer DVD players or sound cards to play it. However because most people aren’t going to upgrade their DVD players soon, these audio DVDs supply same sound tracks in Video_TS folder encoded in usual Dolby Digital or DTS which all players knows how to play.\nNow say you buy an audio album on DVD disc. Obviously you can’t play it on car stereo or your portable MP3 players because it’s a DVD disc rather than normal audio CD. Or you might want to take backup of your DVD-A disc as WMA Pro files on your PC whcih allows 7.1 surround sound and playback. So what you do? You need to convert DVD disc in to normal Audio disc or rip tracks to MP3s. Unfortunately this isn’t easy. The DVD-A format employs higher level of encryption than usual DVDs. The DVD videos (stored in .vob files) employs copy protection scheme called CSS which can be broken in to very easily using DeCSS or even more friendly DVD Decryptor. But DVD-A format which was developed later has learned lesson from this hack and currently there is no known way to decrypt .aob files which contains DVD-A audio tacks. That means you can’t rip MP3s out of AOB files. Your only way out is to rip off from slightly lower quality Dolby/DTS formatted tracks. The most reliable and easy to use software to do this is DVD Audio Extractor. Fortunately many DVD-A albums also provides LPCM version of tracks along with AC3 (i.e. Dolby Digital)/DTS format. So to burn normal audio CDs or MP3s you might want to choose LPCM version. If DVD-A disc doesn’t contain LPCM tracks, than you are out of luck. The down-mix/demux process employed by most software to convert surround sound from AC3/DTS to plain stereo format doesn’t produce same quality as commercially available stereo tracks. Though you can try some equations to combine 5.1 channels in to stereo using SoftEncode etc and usually DTS works better than AC3.\n","date":1099344743,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1099344743,"objectID":"796ff721fbe9a31a417b105f9f7b7b76","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/dvd-audio-format/","publishdate":"2004-11-01T21:32:23Z","relpermalink":"/p/dvd-audio-format/","section":"post","summary":"In my recent quest to find new music, I bumped in to brand new DVD-A format on which many new demanding music albums are being delivered.

This amazing Niagara of energy is probably very different than anything you have heard so far. Some of the tracks were composed with 15 different instruments including PVC pipes and homebrewed hybrid instruments! If you have seen their off-Broadway show, you will probably appreciate this music even more. This show is definitely one of the most creative, energetic, artistic and amusing I’ve ever been too. On other note, they have second album called Complex. In sharp contrast, this album, apparently containing many vocals, comes nowhere close to their first. This album is available in full-blown multi-track surround DVD-A format however it doesn’t contain LPCM stereo tracks, which might force you to by normal CD for MP3 extraction.\nThe Polyphonic Spree - The Beginning Stages Of Polyphonic Spree To give you a highlight, this group is composed of 20 members including 9 dedicated just for choir, humming and making noises. They are also the only one I know of using French horn. The combined effect of this huge mix and diverse instruments is just majestic while recording quality of vocal is not as good but you probably won’t care for the kind of upbeat energy it pours in. While anyone would agree they sound amazing in live concert than on recorded media, I still believe Trans-Siberian Orchestra has still maintained its “absolute best” position with me as far as large bands are concerned. Unfortunately Beginning Stages isn’t available in surround DVD-Audio format. However their second album Together We Are Heavy is indeed available in incredible crystal clear DVD-A surround format but it is probably half as good :(.\nThese albums are available on Rhapsody, although not in surround sound.\n","date":1099338851,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1099338851,"objectID":"f0879121c421612c6a3e765037830b87","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/blue-man-group-and-polyphonic-spree/","publishdate":"2004-11-01T19:54:11Z","relpermalink":"/p/blue-man-group-and-polyphonic-spree/","section":"post","summary":"[Artists - Album]\nBlue Man Group - Audio My short review of this album would be “Insanely creative”.

Last year, just by pure fortune, I was in Adirondacks and in one of the first mornings I saw a sudden blast of color everywhere in the region. So we took the flight over 46 tall mountains (and the countless small ones) that makes up this amazingly beautiful area. The aerial views we saw from the small plane flying low were definitely the best fall foliage view I’ve ever seen (and for the record, I’d been out quite a lot).\nAnyway, last weekend was the day when colors had peaked again at Adirondacks and after a week of blazing show that nature had put there, the area is now past peak (along with Vermont and much of the New Hampshire – which is often compared with China for the best in fall foliage in entire world because of the diversity of trees). But if you plan well, you can still chase the fall foliage on the East coast for this entire month and enjoy the blazing colors in truly awesome settings!

Specifically, in old times (pre 1900s), people used this rare event to measure distance between Earth and Sun. Infect astronomers didn’t knew this distance from a long time, so they invented so-called “1 Astronomical Unit (AU)” when they want to refer to this distance. In old times, everything was measured relative to AU, for example Venus is 0.7AU away from Sun. Venus Transit helped to resole this. Plus it also helped to figure out Sun’s diameter. Now just out of curiosity, I thought, how would Venus transit could help in determining Sun-Earth distance and Sun’s diameter? Answer is simple enough: Have two people watched it from different latitudes on Earth, make a triangle, use simple trigonometry and you get the distance! Nasa has put up a detailed explanation of little math in involved in this clever technique. Then This is, of course, still less accurate then modern ways of radars and satellites. Venus orbits around Sun in just 0.6 years. Then one would think why transits are so rare? Well, answer is, Venus’s orbit isn’t in the same plane as Earth, so it’s pretty rare for Sun-Venus-Earth to get in one straight line, usually every little over hundres years or so. Apart from that, this transit won’t visually appeal to most but if you had those special safe glasses to view sun eclipse, you might have a look between 11:05AM to 11:25AM on US East Coast on June 8, 2004.

This road trip certainly seems to be the queen of all. The presenter been touring this route every couple of years since last 3 decades and had some really awesome photographs - some taken in different seasons and time of the days and some even different decades! Here are some tips from the guru himself: The road trip to CA1 can be done any month, never let weather stop you. Still if you are too picky, in summer (through September) it’s kind of hot. From December to March is good time except that El-Nino may strike the Pacific coast and parts of CA1 suddenly merges in to ocean, yet Feb-March is the best time. This is also the time when you can see lots of white whales in the ocean floating around while watching sunset in Pacific Ocean. The good place to stay overnight on this route is Ragged Point Inn. You might want to frequently take exists in between, specifically for San Simeon Castle. It’s good idea to stay around this gorgeous huge architecture (they have even special tour for just bathrooms among others!). To stay around this building is San Simeon Pines is a good resort. The route is 90 miles long and totally worth an entire day trip. While in presentation, I also stumbled upon list of really gorgeous places to visit in United States. They are special because they have specific times when you should be there. Also they are very diverse (from flower covered moutains to canyons in Utah!). If you get a chance, don’t even think about missing out on them. I certainly won’t :). Here’s my filtered list:\nBryce Canyon National Park, Utah Canyon valleys partially gets covered in snow.

When I started out that time, I wanted to make something really powerful, enviable and which kind of had everything. After burning $3500 in this endeavor I enjoyed owning something that exceeded what Microsoft and others just recently “innovated” as Media Center PC. But this time upgrade wasn’t easy and I kept messing up things many times and calling up other gurus. So here’s the list for the benefit of someone not-so-skilled: 1. Usually motherboards have 3 special screws that would touch the chassis and provide the grounding. Don’t mix up (aha, screw up) those screws. 2. When you lay PC on its side (motherboard top facing you), remember all IDE cable’s red-line side faces you but floppy’s faces down. If you mess this up, drives won’t be detected and you might keep thinking that you blew up power supply and run to buy another one. 3. Power cables to all IDE drives would have yellow side facing you and red side facing IDE cable’s red-line. Usually you can’t plug other way, unless, uhhh… you push really hard! 4. It’s important to see which drive is master and which one is slave (ALWAYS look at the jumper settings before you put drives in bays wire everything up). I didn’t bothered and just keep trying until they all were detected (real reason being I’d lost my flashlight). This won’t blow up your drives but it’s very unreliable. 5. Don’t forget to connect CD digital and DVD SPDF connectors to sound card. Former allows digital ripping of audio CDs in MP3s and later allows Dolby Digital sound if you have the card that supports that and have hooked up to Home Theater system. Also if you want to listen modem noises on speakers (or home theater as in my case), don’t forget to connect modem and sound card. Many cheap modems don’t support this any longer however. 6. If power light blinks then probably you have power supply set on 230V (European style) rather then 115V (US style).\n","date":1062830916,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1062830916,"objectID":"1b0915874b2962f55edcfaf2fd530d03","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/custom-pc-checklist-2003/","publishdate":"2003-09-06T06:48:36Z","relpermalink":"/p/custom-pc-checklist-2003/","section":"post","summary":"I recently upgraded my custom build 2.5 year old beast.

Unlike it was advertised on several web sites, no, it doesn’t get as big as moon when looking through modest telescope. Infect there’s barely any difference when I’d looked at it through same scope in last couple of years. So I just went in to some number crunching using fact sheet at Nasa’s web site, and it seems that Mars should look (at best) 30% more brighter and around 40% bigger then I’d seen couple of years ago. Now the catch is that when looking through telescope with above spec (which is pretty beyond modest 70mm stuff), Mars would normally look like a bright tiny disk. So 40% increase would make that tiny disk little bigger - but still a tiny. To make it look as big as Moon you would need increment of 1000% or more and that’s not going to achievable just by Mars coming closer - it’s possible only though much much bigger scopes. So my conclusion is that news sites and emails that kept circulating were pretty misleading to public. Though the good part is that lots of people suddenly got interested in astronomy. Infect one of my friend was so hopeful that he has put a $100 bet with me on whether Mars would look as big as moon on 27th August with bare naked eyes!

It is flop and it’s sure not as influential as the original. But it’s still totally worth watching. It’s probably the best action film I’ve seen so far. The car chase sequences are anything that you would have seen on the big screen (The car chase in Matrix II now looks like kids play). So it has become one of few movies that I’ve went out to see it twice. If it’s available in your area, choose the theater with Digital Projection (DLP) for fine DVD-like details on big screen.

No freaky stuff in this one and it’s legally free. Pocket Bartender - It’s so convenient to handover your Pocket PC to bartender and ask her to make that drink that no one else has ever heard of! TheSky Pocket Edition - This is probably the best and most popular in it’s category. Think about coming out of your car, tap on your Pocket PC to see real-time sky map and know the name of that star you been wondering about in the middle of nowhere. If you had good telescope, you can even plug-in your pocket pc in to it and control it with pen taps! Other such programs include Pocket Stars and Pocket Universe. The bad thing about TheSky is that there is no trial edition available but I’ve heard that you can make a copy in someway if someone else has it. Don’t ask how! Ephemeris - This is cool little app to show moon phase, sun/moon rise times etc. Helpful if you were like me who won’t mind not sleeping additional one hour to see sun rise! TV Remote Controller - I’ve yet to make this work but the basic idea is that you are sitting in the bar and suddenly TV channel gets changed to Star Trek from some stupid sports game and no one knows how did that happened. Taiyoukei - This is nice set created by a Japanese guy for astronomy. Taiyoukei meaning “solar system”, for example, can tell you which planets are up in the sky right now among many other stuff. EBooks - There are several free (the one on Kazza may not count) ebooks available which you can read on Pocket PC during your bus trips to New York. Special fun are kids books: Alice in the wonderland, Encarta Pocket Dictionary, Adventure of Tom Sawyer and Julius Verne. Apart from these cool stuff, Pocket PC as an operating system totally sucks.

It goes smoothly with occasional emotional bursts until she feels comfortable with the whole thing. And then she can tell jokes and attempt to be funny. She doesn’t try to create exact replica of her album versions, instead almost always she would change tempo, tones and add twists. One often discussed disappointment was new hair style (change from the one with long beautiful hair).

Unfortunetely all of these albums sucks. But anyway, because they are my favorite they will get metion here :). First, Matchbox Twenty has came up with new album More Than You Think You Are. Yes, they continue in tradition of weired names for their albums (oh well… who can make sense of name Matchbox Twenty itself?). I guess they have grown big in last few years but haven’t completely lost their touch. Some tracks are cool. It takes time, experiences, situation to get taste of music from these guys. So far I personally know only one person who likes Matchbox Twenty!! Next, Linkin Park is out with much-awaited Meteora. I’d though this will be something new and fresh but it totally smells like leftover of their previous hit Hybrid Theory. These guys have so much energy and imagination I’d thought it’s not gonna wear them down any sooner. Hopefully they have something cooler in pipeline. Finally, Jewel has got her new single Intuition out. She does hip-hop kind of thing for the first time and pretty much screws it up. She has her new full album 0304 set to be released on June 3, 2003. Hopefully that isn’t all that bad. So if these sucks, what’s cool? Listen to 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane. If while listening some of the lyrics doesn’t seem to make sense, just remember that this album is from duo of teenaged Russian lesbians (and yes, they are hot!). Another is Barenaked Ladies. These canadian guys had most of their releases in last decade, have huge followings and their concerts are considered to be one of the best to go for. Very cool guitar tabs seemlessly going with equally cool vocals and effortlessly flowing lyrics and hummable tunes. If you think they took cheap marketing uproach, wait until you listen to tracks like Pinch me, If I should fall or Light up my room.

I’ve already exploited it in building 3 of the websites (including this one) and one of them was literally built overnight! So well, it proves the point. This is still evolving code and there is not much documentation right now but you can contact me for assistance. Here’s what this library contains:\nTemplated themed page framework: This is easier and different then others. It basically allows you to specify HTML file which will become your template an then you can put markers in that HTML file to indicate where would you want your site title, page title, site logo, menus etc. This is incredibly easy to use and pretty useful if you have raw HTML website and you want to use web forms and other bells and whistles of ASP.Net. This framework can get you started in couple of hours. Navigational menu server control: Really simplified menu server control. You set up your menu hierarchy as well as XHTML menu templates in XML file and this thing will paint it on your page. ListSet server control: This is the heart of the site server control. It is a templated list in nutshell which means you give it a template (UserControl/ascx file) and it would instantiate that template for each row of the data. Inside your template you can use expression like DataBinder.Eval(DirectCast(Container, DataGridItem).DataItem, \u0026#34;columnName\u0026#34;) to paint that row in a way you like. Later if you want to change the look, you just modify template and you don’t even have to recompile. It nicely separates data and UI. Also it is derived from DataGrid instead of Repeater so it supports paging and other funky features.

So here goes my Saturday night updating my photo albums! But in this blog I want to talk little about taking photographs. First, you do not need bulky pricey cameras. The good photos you capture entirely depends on the angle, moment and your judgment rather then technology embedded in camera (gee, and you still call me a geek!). Almost all photos in all of my albums so far were taken from mere 1 Mega pixel digital cameras which had all necessary functionalities but weren’t the high end ones (HP C20 and Sony DCR-100). The key to get good photographs is just to get out more. And every time. Make your will exceed the difficulties posed by weather or other circumstances. For example photos in my new album on Verrazano bridge were taken on one of the cold day in winter with chilling winds. I still remember my hands were frozen at the point of getting numb even after wearing gloves and I couldn’t hold my camera still! Yet in other album on Sun rising from behind the New York City it was even more brutal - I’d forgot my gloves! You won’t feel the chilling winds in those beautiful photos but it were there. If you ask why others don’t have these photos, it’s for simple reason: they weren’t out there. One more thing, you might want to avoid any retouching of your digital photographs unless you really want to do some modern artsy thing. The only thing I would allow on my photos is resize and 90 degree rotate. However tempting it might be, absolutely no enhancements of any type - the world deserves the truth the way you saw it! Finally I must thank the pool of positive feedback last year for these photographs but I guess I do not consider myself an artsy or even dedicated photographer. Infect much of the time I intentionally do not carry my camera or don’t take a snap even if I had one. You do loose capturing some magnificent views but you don’t loose moments :).

I’m pretty much beginner and just had some idea how these caves would have looked like when I read Adventures of Tom Sawyer a decade ago (and this still remains the best book I’ve ever read!) and when I went out on one of the caving trips last summer with AMC. It is simply breathtaking what this planet’s underground holds for you with miles and miles long caves nerves system frequently including super huge tall domes formations and sometime hundreds of spiky icy straws, deep pits and even lakes. These caves can be explored almost all year round because temperatures there stays stable between 50-60 F. However it’s complete darkness there and you got to have helmet with light and some other essential gear. It’s recommended that if you are beginner you go with someone experienced and never go in group of less then four. If you are a good hiker and have some rock climbing experience, it helps but all you really need is a will to crawl, scramble and be there! The National Speleological Society is your starting point to get in touch with gurus and go out in their group outings across United States and Maxico.

Karunesh - Global Spirit - Punjab. Probably a version of folk song in an Indian language Punjabi. Extremely popular 2002 hit in India. Karunesh is a German born artist who later came to India after near-fatal motorbike accident which started off his spiritual journey. Khalid - Khalid - Didi. After you listen to Arabic languages you might wonder, if one can even sing in that. This old global hit might prove you wrong. DJ Aqeel - Ek Haseenna thi - Tu Tu Wahi. One of the Bombay style remix but with very cool vocals. Instant Karma - Dance Masti Again - Aaja Piya. Yet another Bollywood remix with cool vocals. Bally Sagoo - Best of Bally Sagoo - Gur Nalon Ishq Mitha. The bhangra-style music is well known to make your feet move. And when that gets remixed by Bally Sagoo, it a definite dance hit.

My favorite season to be in the City always had been Monsoon (June - Sep) when it rains a lot. However the weather in December is also pleasant 70s (F) and sky is still clear enough for me to spot some shooting stars. Here I’m going to outline few observations as a personal note. If you been to or away from this wonderful, dirty, soulful and one of the greatest cities in the world, here’s the treat for you :). The vegetarian and the non-vegetarian sects seem to have risen in equality in their strength and aggressiveness. Vegetarian burgers were already common place but now you can see vegetarian hot dogs on menus! I even saw the ad for vegetarian tooth paste! But on the other hand much of the college going crowed doesn’t feel any guilt in eating animals. However, vegetarian burgers are just “vada paw” with burger’s bun. The restaurant staff also informed me that hot dog has same material as burger but with different buns. Looks like the City is reinventing American food just as it did decade ago for Chinese food. Much of the “Chinese” food available on Bombay’s street is something that’s most Chinese people are not aware of! Bombay girls, on average, are more free from traditions, modern and sophisticated. However this might be more true for upper middle class and riches. It’s not unusual to find girls smoking in college campuses and no one even gives a second look. While I hate smoking, doing it just as free as a man could and without guilt is a good change. In the New Year’s party that I been to, the clothing style of the crowd there was undistinguishable from a posh nightclub in US. But then again, that party was sponsored by F TV, a new channel in Bombay on fashion stuff. Now there are many more cable channels available then before. However most western TV channel’s have “indianized” themselves to stay in the fierce competition. The MTV India is far far better in quality and presentation then its native US version. The cable internet is now easily available for nearly same cost as dialup, however numbers of hours are limited and you have to pay hefty sum for a modem. Mobile phones are extremely common place and that looks like a booming business. Most phones use European style SIM cards and have pay-and-go billing. The mobile text messaging (SMS) is very common and can be used across the glob (In US, the text messaging standards are different which makes it neither popular nor globally usable). One of the other visible improvements is the numbers of FM channels that has been mushroomed in the City. I found most of them had real good quality programming. That may not be surprising when you realize that most DJs on these radio stations are young and even possibly still college going crawd instead of government employees. So, you know it’s gonna be cool and vibrant stuff. Radio Mirch is one of the nicer ones. There are many more shopping malls then before but still they are quite small (not even 1/4th) compared to giant ones that you can find everywhere in US and UK. Much of the things sold in these malls are direct imports and targeted for relatively rich mass rather then usual middle class. You can get almost anything that’s available in western countries: popular colognes, brand sun glasses, Boss home theater system, DVD + MP3 players, big screen TVs, Play Station 2 and so on. But one of the hard to find thing was Calvin Klein Eternity cologne which I’d forgot to pack with my luggage at last minute! These new malls are starting the change in retain business but most purchasing still happens in street-side small retail stores. However apart from more shopping malls, what city needs right now is more high rises. I saw old and small buildings being replaced by bigger and better looking ones (usually referred as “towers” in the City terminology). However these are usually still limited to 7 floors high. I guess much of the city’s problems like slum areas, unhygienic places and unorganized shops would be instantly solved by putting up real sky scrappers (50+ floors giants) everywhere like in New York and thus creating sufficient room to accommodate everyone nicely. Unfortunately lately I’d heard that some old residents had filed law suits against new high rises and so government is actively thinking about putting a ban on them. The sky scrapers is the reality that have to be accepted at one point or another. Later is not better. There’s no escape. Most people in Bombay feels that the City was improved in last few years by several new flyovers and highways. But it seemed minor changes to me and may even go unnoticed if someone doesn’t tell you. Local trains now all have 12 coaches. I felt that the pollution in the City had reached to suffocating level. But you hear and see different things.

But after spending years in intensive computer programming, Microsoft .Net seems to be the best computer programming environment human kind can possess at this point of time. It’s simply just too perfect (if you forget the stupid “.Net” name tag i.e.) converging several good stuff from lots of things that existed ranging from non-proprietary C++, rival Java, Microsoft’s own VB and my old favorite Borland Delphi. I was kind of surprised at this level of perfection when I first used it and amazed at the numbers of human years that might have been spent to achieve this level of skills to do something this sophisticated flawlessly. So how do you get started? After going through details of more then 200 books, purchasing 10s of them, returning back many out of disappointment, here’s the 4 winners that has finally emerged. These books are probably all you need to learn almost everything you might need to develop advanced applications. I assume good familiarity with VB6, little more then intermediate programming experience and a desire to know low level details. [List arranged by order of importance]\nProgramming Microsoft Visual Basic .NET - Francesco Balena. This one is an absolute must and covers almost everything in single volume. Fun to read and goes deep in to details. This is your ideal starting point if you were a VB6 programmer. ASP.NET Unleashed - Stephen Walther. The ASP.Net is the most changed part between transition from VS6 and it’s the most exciting one. This book, I’ve found, is the best on the subject. .NET Common Language Runtime Unleashed - Kevin R. Burton. Haven’t read this one yet but it looked really cool with MSIL and other low level stuff. Compiling for the .NET Common Language Runtime - John Gough. You don’t know it until you get dirty with details and this book gonna take you in real details. I bought it to understand MSIL, virtual machine, common language issues and in future to make my own compiler for RPL. Microsoft ADO.NET - David Sceppa. The ADO.Net is the center of almost any large scale app and you need to know every little thing about it. While I’ve included this book in the list, I must admit that this one was a disappointment when I tried to find details on some advanced level stuff I was doing for real world application. But still it clears up lots of basics on concurrency handling, typed datasets etc. So, What’s not included in above books? First, the C# language spec is not included because you better off reading it from MSDN. General tasks that you might perform every now and then are at Quickstart tutorials (the HowTo index). However, none of the books that I came across really contains good application architecture strategies that you can use in real world. For this subject, you should check out articles at DevX, Fawcette, asp411 and asp.net. This might be your best bet when it comes to putting principles in to practice. Finally, here’s the books I returned: Instant ASP.NET Applications, ASP.NET Tips \u0026amp; Techniques and Programming Windows with C#.

But the trouble was that by the time they received it they got confused whether it was for last year’s occasion or coming year’s! It’s an art to find a gift that’s unique, hard to find, memorable and the one matching with person’s personality and need. Here are some of those tips and places that I came across over time to help you out this holiday season. 1. The premier destination to get the unique gift idea is surprise.com. A must visit if you are still in the complete darkness. 2. Check out my collection of gift links. You will find things ranging from Kamasutra weekender kit to Astronomy’s cool gift ideas. 3. To find out what’s latest and coolest, check out Scientific American’s Top SciTech Gifts of 2002. This one is a real good contemporary compilation. 4. If you still didn’t found you were looking for, view my collection of shopping links. Specially check for Diversity Stores section. 5. Instead of giving gifts to someone who already has too much, you might want to ask them if it’s ok to give some donations to non-profit organizations instead of giving them yet another gift that would be anyway useless to them. Click here for some charity organizations in my links collection. 6. Finally here are my personal favorites and non-favorites for this year: Quicktionary, Book light (both are perfect if a person is an avid reader), external hard drive (perfect for heavy laptop users because they always run out of space), handheld GPS (for outdoor person), Lego Mindstorm robot kit (absolute perfect gift for kids), DVD/MP3 players, HP49 calc (perfect for mathematicians), model air plane kit (prefer unassembled ones). And now the things that sucks as gifts: fragrances, cloths, pocket PCs and palms, organizers, CD players, pocket MP3 players, RC cars, PS2. These gifts totally suck. Finally it’s not necessary to go overboard. Infect being a follower of ‘Grinch philosophy’ I’m supposed to hate all give and take of gifts.

Both are running at Loews IMAX theater (67th St and Broadway, New York City).\nSpace Station 3D: This is the movie that you don’t want to absolutely miss. Watching this movie on huge 8 story high screen, with 42 speakers and in 3D is probably the next best thing to be actually there in space. It has been shot by actual astronauts with cameras in their helmets. The philosophical thoughts of us being something special is sure to trigger in your mind when you show those awesomely beautiful Earth views filling your entire eye sight on that huge screen. Photography of zero gravity environment, astronauts’ daily lives and their way of having fun is just amazing. Recommended sit: The very first row! Star Wars - Episode II: I’m not a Star Wars fan but this might be worth to check out if you have extra time and money. I’d watched Episode II when it came out earlier this year (it was than running at AMC’s digital cinema which is probably one of very few of it’s kind) but to say the least, it’s the weird story even for geeks! The IMAX version is not really re-created for huge screen and you can clearly see the low resolution distortions in graphic effects when it’s projected on that huge screen. However that chase scene with sky diving sequences in futuristic city are the real treat and totally worth on the extra large screen. The THX digital sound effect also works great. This movie has limited engagement.

The colder environment slows down body functions, helps to dry down the energy levels and drives you towards the kind of “stasis”.

Looks it aren’t all that bad after all :). This one is about the few cool books that I came across on programmer’s life, passions, dreams and thoughts. To tell you the truth, all of them has kept me awake until early mornings since past few months. If you are hard core programmer from the roots, you are in for the real treat! Be hold! The first on the list is Hackers. No, it isn’t about breaking illegally in to some computer system. It’s about the very first computer programmers who put their foot steps in to this new world - like a little curious girl entering in the wild magical world of fairy tales. But more than the technicality, the thing that will touch you, cut your skin and swirl through your soul is the stories of passion that these people had - stories that are now permanently carved in to every page of this little book. A wonderful work. After coming from work, I would usually tell myself that I’m gonna read couple pages and then I’ll got to sleep and almost always I ended up staying awake until 5 in the morning with my face little tired of all those smirks that passed by. I can see myself and my career like a mirror in this book. It’s like reading stories of your ancestors and identifying yourself - or more like explaining yourself why the way you are. I believe you don’t have to be techie to read this book - it’s more a testament than a technology on the heights of human passion that this profession somehow inherently needs you to posses. Second on the list is Hard Drive. It’s about Bill Gates and building of Microsoft during early years (1975-1990). Well, I never really cared about this (this is my first book on the subject) and my perception of Bill Gates was pretty much like “smart business man who got super lucky”. Above book, Hackers, however changed all that. I was actually shocked to know that Bill Gates is really just another hacker - a hard core geek - just like many of others around. And I was just hooked up in to those stories - probably some of the coolest one in Software industry. Author has like picked up all tiny hilarious interesting details. I used to find myself spending hours in conversations about bits from this book and spreading laughs. You just can’t put it down! Last one and which I haven’t finished yet (I’m kind of saving it from reading it entirely) is the Show-Stoppers. It’s hilarious. detailed, passionate and revealing inside stories of one of the biggest software project ever under taken. After reading the Hard Drive I just can’t get enough to know about the Microsoft. This book takes from where Hard Drive leaves - the after 1990 era. And this one is very detailed and that’s why it’s more fun to read. I almost felt like a team member who lived in the NT team - feeling same pressure, finding ways to curse, getting ashamed for blunders and rejoicing for the final target that would be achieved. If you happen to live in programming world, this book is an absolute must Don’t Miss. For others, take it as an optional.\n","date":1036954444,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1036954444,"objectID":"e8bc89a916378a853ac27391971841e4","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/some-books-about-programmers-2002/","publishdate":"2002-11-10T18:54:04Z","relpermalink":"/p/some-books-about-programmers-2002/","section":"post","summary":"Just read couple of reviews of my blogs at Weblog Review.

So now this is happening 3 years in row. Anyway, this blog is about the new cool music artists/albums I found in past few months. It’s starts with Linkin Park’s Hybrid Theory. To say the least, this is the one we call it “a land mark”. Very artsy compositions, meaningful smart lyrics and the best part: hybrid of melody and metal. You can’t possibly miss this one. I haven’t heard so much “visual” music in such quantity and quality. No, you need not be “metal” guy to listen to this. However the word of caution: many of the lyrics and song styles in this album can drive you in to frustration, illusionary fears or induce suicidal thoughts. You do need to be strong to listen to this and very strong to enjoy it. Next on the list is Jewel. When I heard her voice for the first time I was almost stunned by the sweetness and soul embedded in her voice. And to this date, I consider her as the best female vocals on the planet. She writes her own songs though many of them I consider sucks (her poetry book is available on Amazon). Few totally outstanding numbers: “Absence Of Fear”, “Time After Timely”, “Break Me” and “My Hands Are Small”. The first one, the “Absence Of Fear”, I consider the best love song ever written and sung. Many compare (and occasionally mistakes) her to Cranberries but I guess the “souls” these two artists put in their songs have different identities. To hear Jewel is treat to ears and thanks to modern day technology, it’s available to entire world! I’ll include few of my old finds later but before I log out, here’s the very latest: DJ Sammy! I randomly picked up his new CD “Heaven” in the sale at Wiz hoping to hear some cool trans and I glad I did. This is almost perfect (11 out of 13 tracks are vibrantly cool) and easily the second best techno-trans album after Moby’s Play. Tracks are full of life and energy and there’s no repetition… The creativity poured in this album is amazing. Most of the tracks are seamlessly combined with very cool female vocals from Yanou (though she hasn’t got much credit on front CD cover) - a voice with unparalleled sweetness, imagination and passion. Another peculiar quality of this album is that as you hear it too much, instead of getting dull, it keeps getting better - it’s been kind of longest lived CD in my car’s player (i.e. 5 days). You need not be trans-junkie to like this album. It will catch your ears whoever you are. Only thing, being an import CD (euro dance) it costs lot: $18 to $25.\n","date":1036562615,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1036562615,"objectID":"ca4a4616e2bebdd6d7a8cad4bfd8f7f1","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/new-music-finds-nov-2002/","publishdate":"2002-11-06T06:03:35Z","relpermalink":"/p/new-music-finds-nov-2002/","section":"post","summary":"I missed Central Park visit this Sunday.

I’ve found few huge and really cool organizations that engage themselves in doing some interesting adventure outings in groups. The biggest and the best of these is the Sierra Club. It’s purpose of existence is nature conservancy and awareness. Every week they have multiple outings - hikes, kayaks, group dinners, meetings and even outdoor movie shows! The places I’d visited with some of the hike leaders this summer were mind blowing, kind of secret gems… They also have special singles outings which I guess is better place to find that special someone then anywhere else because people who you meet in these clubs are the ones who you can identify with yourself, the spirit of adventure and sense of exploration. The Sierra club is non-profit, has chapter in almost every state in US (I usually go out with NY and NJ chapters) and they excert high influence on US nature policies.\nAnother huge organization is AMC or Appalachian Mountain Club. They stand out by the diversity and huge quantity of outings they offer - including everything from hiking, sailing, kayaking, tour of Brooklyn bridge, night time Central Park, ice caves, all summer softball at Central Park, camping at their own facilities, windjammer cruises, tree identification walks, a day at Coney Island and so on. In spite of these, I like them less compared to Sierra due to couple of reasons. They don’t publish their schedules fully on web and force you to get their printed book. That tiny book takes time to arrive and can easily get misplaced. Many of the hike leaders doesn’t have or disclose their email addresses and at many instances, you will find it hard to contact them by any means even if they disclose anything at all. While most the people you will meet are very respectable and pleasant in person, the Sierra’s flavor of openness and friendly feel is not as strong.\nThe last organization on the list is ADK or Adirondack Mountain Club. Actually this is the first one I came to know about before any other. While it’s small and locally focused on NY/North NJ, I believe it’s the most intimate and friendliest club around. But the coolest things they do which sets them apart from everybody else is their international and national adventure travel. The list includes week-long outings like staying with real Inuit people at Greenland in the way they live, hikes at Swiss Alps, England Coast-to-Coast, trekking with donkeys in France, Grand Canyon backpacking, Alaska rafting and so on.\nA last point: I’ve often observed that that age proportion at many of these vibrant exciting clubs is not well balanced: numbers of young people (in 20s) is strikingly and surprisingly less. I guess it’s responsibility of people like us to spread the word and keep these clubs and spirit alive in the coming time.

Last year I went out to 3 day trip to New Hampshire and drove through much of the state. This year I decided to went down North-east Pennsylvania. The driving route at Bucktail State Park was listed as ‘one of the most beautiful spot to be’ in foliage by Yahoo Travel newsletter. There is some 75 miles of Route 120 which passes through scenic mountainous areas and small towns. So I rented Mustang convertible and started the trip on 20th Oct. Passing through Rough 80 west from NJ to PA was absolutely stunning. Unfortunately you can’t stop on highway to take photographs and there are not many view points on Rt 80. So just look around and drive slow. While entering on Rt 120 at Lock Haven, PA I realized the peak was already passed and there was around 40% or less leafs on trees. A big sigh! But this was anyway as predicted in Foliage report at FallInPA.com. But whatever was left was still absolutely gorgeous. You can tell how beautiful the peak must have been looked like. So after passing Ronovo I decided to drive down south were peak was still expected. I took Rt 144 and I glad I did. This some 70 miles long road was continuously covered with fall colors, passing through deep forest, valleys in curvy snaky ups and down fashion. What a treat! Next year I’ll be back here with proper timing :-). Anyway this was not my first trip and not the last also for this year. The first trip I did was to Windham, NY at Catskills. It was annual ADK (www.adk.org) fall weekend with lots of hikes in around the area. I did the 3 summit hike at Thomas Kole (6 mil) and one another 4 miles hike next day. Fall colors were just starting to appear. You can look at photographs on my web site http://www.ShitalShah.com or their real host at www.dotphoto.com (the name of the album is First Of Autumn). The next fall color trip WILL be at NYC this weekend at Central Park. I’m missing Autumn at NYC since last two years and it’s hardly 40 mins away from my home! Sure NYC is jungle of building but Central Park is just a magical place. I saw some Central Park foliage shots in movie Autumn in New York (it appears just when movie starts, good because you don’t need to see rest of the crap). This weekend I guess is peak weekend in Central Park.\n","date":1036111802,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1036111802,"objectID":"f6f34cd5703f912a11e5e0374a5bf5d7","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/autumn-fall-foliage-long-drives-2002/","publishdate":"2002-11-01T00:50:02Z","relpermalink":"/p/autumn-fall-foliage-long-drives-2002/","section":"post","summary":"I’ve some more time and it’s my first day doing blogs so I’ll put down few more tid bits… This one is about fall foliage travelling I did this year.

I’ve some 200 gigs of stuff scattered around and I realized much of it isn’t really junk!! So gave thought on DVD writers but I have no wish to carry 20 DVDs around. And then suddenly I found this 120GB external hard drive. It’s perfect. One from Iomega comes for around $290 and it’s 7200 RPM (look in Amazon). Another thing on my wish list was portable TV tuner card which I can connect to my laptop or home PC. It might surprise you but I’ve gave up on those “idiot box” type TVs since around year and half. I’ve Radeon All-In-Wonder showing TV on my 20\u0026#34; PC screen. And then there’s Creative 5.1 Dolby card which sends sound signal from my PC to 600W home theater system. Neat, isn’t it? I can use sophisticated program search, record program on my huge hard drives in MPEG, take stills and even view all channels at once (very slow though). But my PC died few days ago. It won’t power up because of that buggy CLSUS II motherboard bug. And now I’m missing South Park and Seinfeld. And so I realized I need to have something that I can plug in to my notebook on the go and watch TV! And I found more the what I asked for. For $80 you can get KWorld external USB TV tuner device which is also an FM tuner! It works on PAL also so good for travelling with laptops to UK and India. Watch out for few others like WinTV - they don’t have these things. Yet another thing that I was looking for was external Dolby 5.1 sound card. For those who have bought expensive computer speakers, well, guys you wasted your money. You can always get 600W home theater system (i.e. amplifier and speakers) and connect it to Dolby 5.1 compatible card. Until last year only such card was Creative Live! 5.1. Now there are many but I guess Creative still rules because they give you optical as well as SPDF outputs. The beauty of external card is that you can carry it with your notebook and instantly start a sort of night club wherever you can find amplifier and speakers (say, your friend’s bachelor party) streaming out your favorite MP3s. As you might know, most non-geeks who have home theater systems don’t know how to connect it to PC.\n","date":1036109591,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1036109591,"objectID":"61fa2b17aefe1e3154c66bcff50d35b2","permalink":"http://shital.com/p/gizmos-backup-drive-usb-tv-external-dolby-sound-card/","publishdate":"2002-11-01T00:13:11Z","relpermalink":"/p/gizmos-backup-drive-usb-tv-external-dolby-sound-card/","section":"post","summary":"Here’s some of the very cool gizmos I’ve found: I was looking for a backup device for a long time.

I’m always on look out for new music. Already have few thousand songs here and there, but too much is not enough! There are now two online music services available: Yahoo’ Launch and Lycos’ Rhapsody (it’s playing “Pure Moods III” right now on my laptop). The Yahoo Launch is free and it will sequence up the new music for you by looking at your likings and ratings. Very cool. It did correctly picked up many of my favorites from some of the sample ratings I gave to it. A relief for someone like me who have exhausted out of choices. It has tons of online free videos. That’s super cool because MTV sucks at showing music videos these days and I desperately needed some on-demand music video service. And here it goes! Saying that, however, Launch collection isn’t really very big - i.e. it doesn’t have 10s of thousands of songs - just few thousands. There steps in the Rhapsody. They charge $10/mo and you can listen online to their collection of some 10000 CDs. It’s like carrying that many CDs to your work or a hotel or Starbucks :-). You can even burn selected tracks to CD for $1/track. But there is no videos. Many of my favorites I found there: Matchbox 20, Lincoln Park, Enigma, Moby… Some I didn’t found were Jewel, Enya and many others. So it’s kind of balanced collection but imagine, full CDs - right there waiting to get played!

You can ask it to go somewhere and it will show you arrows pointing direction where you should move. It can even tell you where are the nearest restaurants, restrooms, shops and so on!\nNote: Many map related features may available only for USA.\nPlusPoints This model from Garmin is one of the most advanced pocket GPS. Maps are really accurate sometime showing even very small corner shops! It tell you at what speed you are moving, how much time it would take it to reach destination. You can type the mailing address and it will locate it on map and direct you there!! You can make a search on nearest gas station, hotels, tourist attractions, night clubs, hospitals an so on. It will tell you where exactly it is, it’s phone number, how far is it and an real time arrow showing how to get there. It even gives you phases of sun and moon. You can zoom and pan the map. You can mark points on map and name them (it’s called waypoints) and you can even record where you are passing through and trace it back to get home! You can type in the mailing address and/or zip code and get there. Or you can know the postal address of place you are standing on! The built in memory can store street map of one of the US state. But fortunately it’s expandable and I usually keep maps of NY, NJ, PN always there. These features are important, don’t buy without them!\nNote: Many map related features may available only for USA.\nMinusPoints I wasn’t able to find a way to mark your current location as a waypoint (bad if you want to come back there again and you didn’t knew how did you got there). There is NO real time built in compass - the biggest drawback compared to Magellan’s model. However latest problem I’ve faced since last few months is that the power switch doesn’t work on random occasion (no! I didn’t do anything!). It really sucks when you keep pressing that button when you really need it and it doesn’t turn on!\nCost GPS + extra 64MB memory + Metro guide CD + PC cable + car adapter + leather pouch = $450, December 2000\nBetterThenThis There is equivalent model from Magallen and it has buit-in electronic compass but then some other features were missing.

Each MP3 CD can contain 150 songs. So just 3-4 CDs may have all songs you ever want to listen! Especially if you are on long drive, you don’t have to carry tons of CDs with you and flip them around all the time.\nPlusPoints This model from Memorex had most features I wanted. Infect it was the only one during Christmas, 2000 which had those features like search, DSP, good antiskip, support for 132K+ bit rate, CD-RW compatibility, car kit, MP3 tag support. These features are important, don’t buy without them!\nMinusPoints The size is slightly bigger the normal CD player and it’s bit heavy. The biggest problem is however it doesn’t remember the last play mode and song position when you turn on the power again. The random play mode, which I use 90% of the time, is not default. It also doesn’t switch to external power from battery (like a laptop) when it becomes available. Also antiskipping doesn’t seems to be happening. Another really bad thing I experienced was it corrupts normal auto CD! After I play my normal audio CDs couple of time it usually becomes useless! But no harm done at all to MP3 CDs. But this is my guess and my CDs were getting older. Also I think some of MP3 files, specially those with very high bit rates, might not get played.\nCost 130 (Dec 2000)\nBetterThenThis After reading The Bad Part above, well, this can’t be the best.
