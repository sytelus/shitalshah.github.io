      <title>Git Workflow: Branch - Rebase - Squash - Merge</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/git-workflow-branch-rebase-squash-merge/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2017 09:16:43 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/git-workflow-branch-rebase-squash-merge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to make a change to your git repo while other people may also be simultaneously working on the same repo. As it takes you longer to make your changes, there is a greater chance that your local repo might already be out of date as other people have pushed their changes. In this setting, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to make your changes directly in master because otherwise you might end up creating large merge commits which makes your repo&amp;rsquo;s history convoluted and not very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the better git workflow you might want to use in any team of size &amp;gt; 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you make changes, create a branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b MyFeature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next make changes, do commits as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to rely on your hard drive, you can also keep pushing the changes in your branch on the server every once in a while,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push -u origin MyFeature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are done with all your changes, first you want to rebase your branch to master. If master has no new changes since you had created your branch, this will be essentially be no-op. But otherwise, git will take all your commits and play them back on the top of master. This way your commits will look like as if they happened on latest version of master instead of the version you branched out from. This will make commit history of your repo clean and easy to reason about. If you were the only developer, this might not be very important but if there is more than just you then it makes easy to see for other people changes every one is making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do rebase, first get latest master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout master
git pull origin master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then go back to your branch and rebase, i.e.,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout Myfeature
git rebase master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are lucky, you won&amp;rsquo;t see the word &amp;ldquo;conflict&amp;rdquo; in git messages but otherwise there is more work for you! If someone already changed file sections you have also changed then you might see list of conflicts. If you get lost in too many messages, use this command to see pending conflicts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now about resolving conflicts&amp;hellip; there are lots of tools out there and most unfortunately have some problem/confusion installing or using. If you absolutely want GUI tool, install &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DiffMerge&lt;/a&gt;, make sure its in your path and invoke it like,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git mergetool -t diffmerge .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However my preferred method is to simply open up conflicted file in editor, search for &amp;ldquo;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; and review sections that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; HEAD
This is change in master
=======
This is change in your branch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-a
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now keep the change you want, delete the markers and you are done with that conflict. Another shortcut is to just tell git to take master&amp;rsquo;s version (&amp;ldquo;ours&amp;rdquo;) or your branch&amp;rsquo;s version(&amp;ldquo;theirs&amp;rdquo;). For example, to resolve all conflicts by overriding using your changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout . --theirs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tricky conflict is when file gets deleted by one person and simultaneously changed by you or vice versa. In this case, git will put a deleted file back in your repo and you have to decide either keep that one and/or remove/update your version. You won&amp;rsquo;t have markers this time like above. I tend to use tool like Beyond Compare to compare two files and make edits as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell git that you have resolved all conflict,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can continue with your rebase,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rebase --continue
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to continue because of whatever reason,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rebase --abort
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime git might error out while doing continue because there is nothing to commit (may be it detected that the change already exists upstream). In that case you can do,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git rebase --skip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, your changes are now on the top of latest master. You can verify this by looking at quick history of latest 10 commits,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git log --pretty=oneline -n 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that everything still reside in your own branch. If you are not yet ready to push to master, keep working in your branch doing more commits as you go. After rebase if you want to save your branch on server, you must do &amp;ndash;force because you are rewriting history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push --force origin Myfeature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perfectly fine as long as you are the only one working on the branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are ready to push, first merge your branch with master,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout master
git merge --squash MyFeature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t give any errors or conflict messages because your branch was already synced up to latest master. The &amp;ndash;squash tells git to combine all your commit in to single commit. This is good idea most of the time if you have done lots of commits like &amp;ldquo;added forgotten file&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;fixed minor typo&amp;rdquo; and so on. It&amp;rsquo;s too much noise and not nice to other people for having to scroll through tons of minor commits to figure out your higher level goals. However its also ok if you don&amp;rsquo;t want &amp;ndash;squash option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally do the commit after the merge,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -m &#34;MyFeature does X&#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you did &amp;ndash;squash above then you will see only one commit in your history at the top of previous commits with above message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can decide to push your changes to master OR move your changes to new branch and keep working. To move to new branch and revert master to original state,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b MyFeature2
git checkout master
git reset --hard origin/master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OR if you are happy, go ahead and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case you can delete the old branch,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin -delete MyFeature
git branch -d MyFeature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you are done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, there are many ways to do things in git. There is another quicker and simpler way to achieve goal of clean history but its bit limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make your changes in master, do commits as usual - but don&amp;rsquo;t push. Once in a while you want to sync up with master. To do this use,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull --rebase
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will get all changes from master and then play back your unpushed commits on the top of them. This may generate conflicts as described above so resolve them in same way. Once you are done with your changes, you can push your commits and they should appear on the top without extra merge commits. An obvious problem here is that you can&amp;rsquo;t push until you are really done with changes so this might be ok for quick short changes. If you want to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; your commits on server or work from multiple machines for multiple days without pushing to master then above workflow would work better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Playing with HoloLens</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/playing-with-hololens/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2016 00:15:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/playing-with-hololens/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few days ago I got chance to play with HoloLens. Here&amp;rsquo;s the clip I shot from HoloLens in my bedroom during first few minutes with the device. The video posted directly from the HoloLens to YouTube, no postprocessing, and it&amp;rsquo;s very close to what I was seeing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvDrgW4pp-8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Few things that surprised me was how easy it was to just put on the HoloLens and start using it. No calibrations or other complicated settings required! My 3 year old and mother-in-law could take turns without modifying any settings. You can operate the whole device pretty much by using just two gestures and it took about 30 seconds to learn them. Given that how often gesturing fails, I was actually more impressed by its accuracy than almost every other feature. I can even type on virtual keyboard, although it does get tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put HoloLens through the battery of tests, some in low light environments like in above video, others around untextured walls and still more in outdoors with relatively large areas and bunch of trees. In all cases, virtual objects maintained their poses in real world and HoloLens knew its own pose fairly accurately. I can put an object in one of the bushes around my home, quickly look away, go around the corner and come back from totally different angle and it&amp;rsquo;s there just like I&amp;rsquo;d put it! Beyond this simplistic tests to see how well SLAM and feature matching algos worked, I also tried out apps like HoloTours and shootout game. In HoloTours, you can see places in Rome and Peru rendered around you in 360-degree! It absolutely impressed me that even though glass is transparent, I can&amp;rsquo;t actually see objects in real world when these 360-degree video was rendered. This is like having VR instead of AR and the black actually looked fairly black. However this is true only for reasonably lit environments. If you have a bright lights in the background, you can &amp;ldquo;see through&amp;rdquo; the virtual environment and &amp;ldquo;VR mode&amp;rdquo; is not convincing any more. In this VR like environment, I thought resolution was fairly good. It&amp;rsquo;s not as if you are watching HD but still it felt better than SD and not falling short for the VR-like experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things can get pretty real though. I put a roaring dragon spewing fire on the floor and gave HoloLens to my 3 year old to view it. He took one look and said he didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to see that scary thing again! This was absolutely mesmerizing and addictive. I also checked out galaxy and solar system apps that you often see in Magic Leap demo videos except that you can actually try out in HoloLens right now! I can totally see how this can become indispensable educational tool with well made apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question in everyone&amp;rsquo;s mind: what about field of view? At first I noticed it quite a bit but then got used it. The bottom line is that the whole experience is so magical that you will forget about it pretty soon and your brain seems to adjust to it. It&amp;rsquo;s like when first TVs came out and they were small and black-and-white and low resolution but hey, you are seeing moving images in your home and people still can get immersed in it! In fact, the more bothering thing for me was the color bleeding when you move your head around. I&amp;rsquo;m suspecting if that was the reason I often started to feel bit of headaches after 30 minutes of use. Still having completely untethered device that can do such heavy computational lifting on single battery charge is just totally amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing Generic Container Functions in C&#43;&#43;11</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/writing-generic-container-function-in-c11/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2016 09:24:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/writing-generic-container-function-in-c11/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want to write function to append one vector to another. It can be done like,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
void append(Vector&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp; to, const Vector&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp; from)
{
    to.insert(to.end(), from.begin(), from.end());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem with this approach is that we can only use this function with Vector. So what about all other container types? In languages such as C#, we have IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; that simplifies lot of things but with C++ templates are duck typed and it takes bit more to make above function generic for various container types. Another quick and dirty route is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;typename Container&amp;gt;
void append(Container&amp; to, const Container&amp; from)
{
    to.insert(to.end(), from.begin(), from.end());
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this approach is that any class with begin() and end() will now qualify for this call. In fact, just in case someone has class with these methods which actually isn&amp;rsquo;t implemented as iterator, you can get some nasty surprises. A simple modification is to make sure we call begin() and end() from std namespace instead of the ones defined on class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;typename Container&amp;gt;
void append(Container&amp; to, const Container&amp; from)
{
    using std::begin;
    using std::end;
    to.insert(end(to), begin(from), end(from));
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, this is better but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if can we restrict the types passed on to this function to only those which strictly behaves like STL containers? Enter type traits! First, we need to define SFINAE type trait for containers. Fortunately Louis Delacroix who developed &lt;a href=&#34;http://louisdx.github.io/cxx-prettyprint/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;prettyprint library&lt;/a&gt; has already fine tuned this code extensively. Below is mostly his code with a my slight modification that allows to pass it through GCC strict mode compilation. This is lot of code so I would usually put this in a separate file, say, type_utils.hpp, so you can use it for many generic container methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#ifndef commn_utils_type_utils_hpp
#define commn_utils_type_utils_hpp

#include &amp;lt;type_traits&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;valarray&amp;gt;

namespace common_utils { namespace type_utils {
    //from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louisdx/cxx-prettyprint/master/prettyprint.hpp
    //also see https://gist.github.com/louisdx/1076849
    namespace detail
    {
        // SFINAE type trait to detect whether T::const_iterator exists.

        struct sfinae_base
        {
            using yes = char;
            using no  = yes[2];
        };

        template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
        struct has_const_iterator : private sfinae_base
        {
        private:
            template &amp;lt;typename C&amp;gt; static yes &amp; test(typename C::const_iterator*);
            template &amp;lt;typename C&amp;gt; static no  &amp; test(...);
        public:
            static const bool value = sizeof(test&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(nullptr)) == sizeof(yes);
            using type =  T;

            void dummy(); //for GCC to supress -Wctor-dtor-privacy
        };

        template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
        struct has_begin_end : private sfinae_base
        {
        private:
            template &amp;lt;typename C&amp;gt;
            static yes &amp; f(typename std::enable_if&amp;lt;
                std::is_same&amp;lt;decltype(static_cast&amp;lt;typename C::const_iterator(C::*)() const&amp;gt;(&amp;C::begin)),
                             typename C::const_iterator(C::*)() const&amp;gt;::value&amp;gt;::type *);

            template &amp;lt;typename C&amp;gt; static no &amp; f(...);

            template &amp;lt;typename C&amp;gt;
            static yes &amp; g(typename std::enable_if&amp;lt;
                std::is_same&amp;lt;decltype(static_cast&amp;lt;typename C::const_iterator(C::*)() const&amp;gt;(&amp;C::end)),
                             typename C::const_iterator(C::*)() const&amp;gt;::value, void&amp;gt;::type*);

            template &amp;lt;typename C&amp;gt; static no &amp; g(...);

        public:
            static bool const beg_value = sizeof(f&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(nullptr)) == sizeof(yes);
            static bool const end_value = sizeof(g&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(nullptr)) == sizeof(yes);

            void dummy(); //for GCC to supress -Wctor-dtor-privacy
        };

    }  // namespace detail

    // Basic is_container template; specialize to derive from std::true_type for all desired container types

    template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
    struct is_container : public std::integral_constant&amp;lt;bool,
                                                        detail::has_const_iterator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::value &amp;&amp;
                                                        detail::has_begin_end&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::beg_value  &amp;&amp;
                                                        detail::has_begin_end&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::end_value&amp;gt; { };

    template &amp;lt;typename T, std::size_t N&amp;gt;
    struct is_container&amp;lt;T[N]&amp;gt; : std::true_type { };

    template &amp;lt;std::size_t N&amp;gt;
    struct is_container&amp;lt;char[N]&amp;gt; : std::false_type { };

    template &amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
    struct is_container&amp;lt;std::valarray&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; : std::true_type { };

    template &amp;lt;typename T1, typename T2&amp;gt;
    struct is_container&amp;lt;std::pair&amp;lt;T1, T2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; : std::true_type { };

    template &amp;lt;typename ...Args&amp;gt;
    struct is_container&amp;lt;std::tuple&amp;lt;Args...&amp;gt;&amp;gt; : std::true_type { };

}}  //namespace
#endif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can use these traits to enforce what types gets accepted in to your generic function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &#34;type_utils.hpp&#34;

template&amp;lt;typename Container&amp;gt;
static typename std::enable_if&amp;lt;type_utils::is_container&amp;lt;Container&amp;gt;::value, void&amp;gt;::type
append(Container&amp; to, const Container&amp; from)
{
    using std::begin;
    using std::end;
    to.insert(end(to), begin(from), end(from));
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much better!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to use Windows network share from domain joined machine on Linux</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/how-to-use-windows-network-share-from-domain-joined-machine-on-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2016 21:22:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/how-to-use-windows-network-share-from-domain-joined-machine-on-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m seeing lot of websites with bit outdated or incomplete instructions. So here are the full steps that works for Ubuntu 14 for mounting Windows network file share on Ubuntu through active directory domain account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you need to install cifs-utils. Check if you already have it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dpkg -l cifs-utils
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, just install it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can mount Windows shares anywhere but /mnt is generally preferred. Another often used location is /media but in modern environments /mnt is more preferred for things that users mount manually while /media is more preferred for things that system would mount for you. Regardless, you should create a folder where the content of your share will appear. Run following command to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: In this guide, replace ALL_CAPS words with values you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p /mnt/FOLDER
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run the mount command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo mount -t cifs //SERVER/FOLDER /mnt/FOLDER -o username=USER,domain=DOMAIN,iocharset=utf8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We set iocharset to utf8. This is optional but better than default charset ISO 8859-1 that Linux uses for mount.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some websites uses filemod/dirmode to 777 (i.e. grant all permissions). This is usually not necessary. &lt;/ol&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s it! If you need to unmount share then run the command,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo umount //SERVER/FOLDER
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    

&lt;p&gt;One problem is that, you will need to run mount command every time after you restart again. While there are ways to connect network shares at startup, they often involve storing your passwords and not recommended. So usually I would just add a line in my ~/.bash-aliases file like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;alias mountshare=&#39;sudo mount -t cifs //SERVER/FOLDER /mnt/FOLDER -o username=USER,domain=DOMAIN,iocharset=utf8&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    

&lt;p&gt;So next time when I need share, I just type &lt;code&gt;mountshare&lt;/code&gt; on command line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How to Enable and Use GCC Strict Mode Compilation</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/how-to-enable-and-use-gcc-strict-mode-compilation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2016 01:19:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/how-to-enable-and-use-gcc-strict-mode-compilation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the great feature that many C++ programmers rarely use is GCC strict mode compilation. Enabling this lets compiler warn you about any potential issues that might often get unnoticed in build noise. Unfortunately there is little documentation, let alone quick tutorial on this subject so I thought to write this up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s clear this up: There is no official GCC mode called &amp;ldquo;strict&amp;rdquo;. I just made that term up. Fortunately there are enough compiler options that you can rig up to create &amp;ldquo;strict&amp;rdquo; mode that is often available in many other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the &amp;ldquo;strict&amp;rdquo; mode, I use following command line options for gcc/g++. Below are written in format consumable in CMakeList.txt but you can use same options from pretty much anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS &#34;-std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra  -Wstrict-aliasing -pedantic -fmax-errors=5 -Werror -Wunreachable-code -Wcast-align -Wcast-qual -Wctor-dtor-privacy -Wdisabled-optimization -Wformat=2 -Winit-self -Wlogical-op -Wmissing-include-dirs -Wnoexcept -Wold-style-cast -Woverloaded-virtual -Wredundant-decls -Wshadow -Wsign-promo -Wstrict-null-sentinel -Wstrict-overflow=5 -Wswitch-default -Wundef -Wno-unused -Wno-variadic-macros -Wno-parentheses -fdiagnostics-show-option ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS}&#34;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a looong list of compiler options so now I hope you can agree that we really mean &amp;ldquo;strict&amp;rdquo; business here :). In essence it enables extra warnings and makes all warnings as errors, points out coding issues that borderlines on pedantic and then on top of that enables some more warnings. Rest assured, above is not an overkill. You are going to thank compiler for taking care of these stuff as your code base becomes larger and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, road from here has lots of twist and turns. The first thing that might happen to you is that you will get tons of errors, most likely not from your own code but from the included headers that you don&amp;rsquo;t own! Because of the way C++ works, other people&amp;rsquo;s bad code in their included header becomes your liability. Except for Boost and standard library, I haven&amp;rsquo;t found many packages that can get through strict mode compilation. Even for relatively nicely written packages such as ROS you will get tons of compiler errors and for badly written packages such as DJI SDK, forget about it. Right&amp;hellip; So now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the fix I have used with fair amount of success. First, declare these two macros in some common utility file you have in your project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
#define STRICT_MODE_OFF                                                                 \ 
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic push&#34;)                                            \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wreturn-type\&#34;&#34;)             \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor\&#34;&#34;) \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wunused-parameter\&#34;&#34;)        \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-pedantic\&#34;&#34;)                 \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wshadow\&#34;&#34;)                  \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wold-style-cast\&#34;&#34;)          \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wswitch-default\&#34;&#34;)

/* Addition options that can be enabled 
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wpedantic\&#34;&#34;)                \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wformat=\&#34;&#34;)                 \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Werror\&#34;&#34;)                   \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Werror=\&#34;&#34;)                  \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic ignored \&#34;-Wunused-variable\&#34;&#34;)         \
*/
              
#define STRICT_MODE_ON                                                                  \
    _Pragma(&#34;GCC diagnostic pop&#34;)          
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have two macros, one tells GCC to turn off selected warnings before some chunk of code and second tells GCC to re-enable it. Why can&amp;rsquo;t we just turn off all strict mode warnings at once? Because GCC currently doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that option. You must list every individual warning :(. Above list is something I just put together while dealing with ROS and DJI SDK and is obviously incomplete. Your project might encounter more stuff in which case you will need to keep adding in to above list. Another issue you might encounter is that GCC currently doesn&amp;rsquo;t support suppressing every possible warnings! Yes, a big oops there. One of them that I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dji-sdk/Onboard-SDK-ROS/issues/27&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recently encountered in DJI SDK&lt;/a&gt; was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;warning: ISO C99 requires rest arguments to be used
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way out for me in this case was to modify DJI&amp;rsquo;s source code and submit the issue to them so hopefully they will fix it in next release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have above macros, you can place them around problematic headers. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;vector&amp;gt;

STRICT_MODE_OFF
#include &amp;lt;ros/ros.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;actionlib/server/simple_action_server.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;dji_sdk/dji_drone.h&amp;gt;
STRICT_MODE_ON

#include &#34;mystuff.hpp&#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not out of the water yet because above trick will work only for some header files. The reason is that GCC sometime doesn&amp;rsquo;t compile entire file as soon as it encounters #include statement. So it&amp;rsquo;s pointless to put macros around those #include statements. Solving those issues requires some more work, and in some cases a lot more work. The trick I used was to create wrappers around things you use from bad headers such that only those wrappers needs to use &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;BadStuff.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements and rest of your code doesn&amp;rsquo;t need those header. Then you can disable strict mode for the wrappers and rest of your code remains clean. To do this, you would need to implement &lt;a href=&#34;https://herbsutter.com/gotw/_100/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pimpl pattern&lt;/a&gt; in your wrapper classes so that all objects in BadStuff.h are behind opaque member. Notice that &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;BadStuff.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statements would be in your wrapper.cpp file, not wrapper.hpp file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this might require significant work in big project, it&amp;rsquo;s often worth it because you are clearly separating interface and dependency for the external stuff. Your own code then remains free of &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;BadStuff.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This will enable you to do even more things like static code analysis just for your code. In either case, consider contributing to those project with bad stuff and make them pass strict compilation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as it happens, working strict mode requires buy off from C++ community. If everyone isn&amp;rsquo;t doing it then it becomes hard for others. So, tell everyone and start using yourself today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two files that contains all stories and comments posted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; from its start in 2006 to May 29, 2014 (exact dates are below). This was downloaded using simple program available I wrote  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News Downloader&lt;/a&gt; by making REST API calls to &lt;a href=&#34;https://hn.algolia.com/api&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HN&amp;rsquo;s official APIs&lt;/a&gt;. The program used API parameters to paginate through created date of items to retrieve all posts and comments. The file contains entire sequence of JSON responses exactly as returned by API call in JSON array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hnstoriesall-json&#34;&gt;HNStoriesAll.json&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contains all the stories posted on HN from &lt;code&gt;Mon, 09 Oct 2006 18:21:51 GMT&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Thu, 29 May 2014 08:25:40 GMT&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;total-count&#34;&gt;Total count&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1,333,789&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;file-size&#34;&gt;File size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.2GB uncompressed, 115MB compressed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-was-this-created&#34;&gt;How was this created&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a small program &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hacker News Downloader&lt;/a&gt; to create these files, available at Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;format&#34;&gt;Format&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entire file is JSON compliant array. Each element in array is json object that is exactly the response that returned by HN Algolia REST API. The property named `hits` contains the actual list of stories. As this file is very large we recommend json parsers that can work on file streams instead of reading entire data in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-to-download&#34;&gt;Where to download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As GitHub restricts each file to be only 100MB and also has policies against data ware housing, these files are currently hosted at FileDropper.com. Unfortunately FileDropper currently shows ads with misleading download link so be careful on what link you click. Below is the screenshot FileDropper shows and currently the button marked in red would download the actual file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;few-points-of-interests&#34;&gt;Few points of interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API rate limit is 10,000 requests per hour or you get blacklisted. I tried to be even more conservative by putting 4 sec of sleep between calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to keep entire response from the call as-is. So return value of this function is used to stream a serialized array of JSON response objects to a file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the output files are giant JSON files, you will need a JSON parser that can use streams. I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://james.newtonking.com/json&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JSON.NET&lt;/a&gt; which worked out pretty well. You can find the sample code in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsDownloader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In total 1.3M stories and 5.8M comments were downloaded and each took about ~10 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see all of HN stories and comments so far fits in to under just 1GB compressed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-and-suggestions&#34;&gt;Issues and Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know any issues and suggestions in comments. You can also file issue at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/HackerNewsData&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; Github repo&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d created for this data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Viewing Venus Transit in Seattle Area</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2012 23:05:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/viewing-venus-transit-in-seattle-area/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, bad news. Weather isn’t looking good for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.space.com/15900-transit-venus-2012-skywatching-guide-gallery.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tomorrow’s historic event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like 80% chance of showers almost entire Pacific Northwest extending even in to Eastern Washington. Even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/060512_transit.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LIGO Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is not going to have sun shine. But if&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you believe that a hole in the sky might appear just to take pick then there are [several events&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lined up for public viewing]&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.seattlesciencefestival.org/icalrepeat.detail/2012/06/05/932/transit-of-venus-viewing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; with free entry and no registration. Public events are much safer way to view Venus Transit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because they would have appropriate solar filters and/or projection boards. Some might even have live webcasts. If that much&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anticipated hole in the sky does not appear then here are the options for online viewing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/webcasts/nasaedge/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NASA Live Webscast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be also good time to brush up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/04jun_arcofvenus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Venus peculiarities&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Groups, Places and Collectives for Makers in Seattle Area</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/groups-places-and-collectives-for-makers-in-seattle-area/</link>

      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/groups-places-and-collectives-for-makers-in-seattle-area/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We went to Mini Makers Faire in Seattle today and one of most surprising thing I learned was how abundant are the local&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;resources for hackers and makers! Reminded me of geek fairy tales of &lt;a href= &#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew\_Computer\_Club&#34;&gt;Homebrew Computer Club&lt;/a&gt; that you often hear. Here are some of the things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you want to check out if you are interested in making stuff and live in Seattle area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://metrixcreatespace.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Metrix Create: Space&lt;/a&gt; – I think this was the coolest thing I came to know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a shop with everything from sewing machine to electronics. They run lots of interesting &lt;a href= &#34;http://wiki.metrixcreatespace.com/workshops&#34;&gt;workshops &amp;amp; classes&lt;/a&gt;. It’s your neighborhood fab lab!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.makeseattle.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Make Seattle Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt; – Regular meet ups for Arduino/electronics makers and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learners to exchange ideas and get help on your projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wstoollibrary.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;West Seattle Tools Library&lt;/a&gt; – I thought this was the coolest concept. They have a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;collection of 1500 tools that you can checkout for your projects. Just look at their &lt;a href= &#34;http://wstoollibrary.org/category/education/tool-of-the-week/&#34;&gt;tool of the week&lt;/a&gt; series. There is also &lt;a href= &#34;http://wsfixers.org/&#34;&gt;Fixers Collective&lt;/a&gt; who meet up at Tools Library and would be happy to fix your broken stuff or just&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tinker around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Xbot Robotics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop Space]&lt;a href=&#34;http://xbotrobotics.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=51&amp;amp;Itemid=58&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; – They provide you space to work on your projects along with access to almost everything you need such as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;power tools, soldering stations, oscilloscopes, electronics components, drill presses, sand blasters, table saws, sanders,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;grinders!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few of cool things we saw there everything from [The&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain Machine]&lt;a href=&#34;http://ladyada.net/make/brain/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logos-electro.com/zigduino/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zigduino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href= &#34;http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/06/11/montys_robot/&#34;&gt;Lifesuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href= &#34;http://www.marginallyclever.com/category/drawbot-my-creations/&#34;&gt;Drawbots&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href= &#34;http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Most-Useless-Machine/&#34;&gt;The Most Useless Machine Ever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also jotted down the next classes I want to do at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pratt.org/classes.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pratt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href= &#34;http://www.allmetalarts.org/classes/&#34;&gt;All Metal Arts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Burning Man Tips for the First Timers</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/burning-man-tips-for-the-first-timers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2010 23:46:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/burning-man-tips-for-the-first-timers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no substitute to reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.burningman.com/preparation/event_survival/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;official Survival Guide&lt;/a&gt; but it does leaves out many things. So instead of writing my detailed trip report I thought about all the mistakes I’d made and converting them to tips. Here it goes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun shelter (things that look like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/731380&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;REI Alcove&lt;/a&gt;) is absolutely essential if you just have a camping tent. I would however not recommend REI Alcove itself because it broke after withstanding 3 days of sandstorms. Obviously you also need &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/766564&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;nice camping chair&lt;/a&gt; to go with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular tent stacks are not very useful to secure tents on playa. I didn’t believed that and my tent almost came out in sandstorms. The correct way to secure tent in playa is using something called “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1vZ1xh8/R-100323499/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;amp;storeId=10051&amp;amp;catalogId=10053&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rebars&lt;/a&gt;”. You need 4 rebars for a regular camping tent, each 3” long and 1/2” wide. You need another 4 or 6 for sun shelter. Stores like Home Depot would cut the metal rod for you in these sizes. Of course, you will need big hammer as well to stack them (they don’t have pointy end). Finally, it’s a hazard to leave other end of these rusty metal rods open so you must stick a tennis ball or empty bottles on end of the rod that is sticking out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandstorms!&lt;/strong&gt; In 2009 there were 3 full days of sandstorms. If you never seen one then here’s how it works: About 20-60 foot tall wall of sand that comes at you at anywhere between 10 miles to 40 miles an hour. The visibility typically drops to 5ft to 50ft and you see brownish sand everywhere around you. This can last for up to 8 hours straight. It actually looks cool and as a matter of fact I intentionally spent lots of time inside sandstorm taking photos (note: Many SLRs are not dust proof). Even on severe storm days almost everyone continued their activities as if it was normal weather. But they were prepared. Here’s what you need to be prepared:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to have sun glasses with minimum open space around lenses. I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/766496&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tifosi Ventoux&lt;/a&gt; and they worked kind of OK. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/search?cat=8000&amp;amp;cat=4500069&amp;amp;cat=4500650&amp;amp;hist=cat%2C4500069%3ASunglasses^cat%2C4500650%3ASunglass+Retainers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;retainer&lt;/a&gt; is also essential not to loose them (remember there are no shops to buy extra pair).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mask for the nose and mouth. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buffwear.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=1_5&amp;amp;sort=2a&amp;amp;max=1000000&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Buff bandana&lt;/a&gt; so I can pull it up all the way to sunglasses. Next time I would also be using &lt;a href=&#34;http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Health/Safety/Products/Catalog/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GE3E02LES9MG812H2_nid=XKJJ787RSQbeF3RH7CD92Ngl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/769766&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icanbreathe.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; mask so I can be absolutely worry free about staying longer out in dust storms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hat with cord and visor. This will allow you to walk heads down while visor protects your face. I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sundayafternoons.com/store/adventure-hats.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this hat&lt;/a&gt; and it’s absolutely the best hat I’ve ever owned. Added advantage of this hat is that it’s veil can be put in the direction of wind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a first timer I found that 4 nights provides a very good breadth and depth for the experience. The reason it’s perfect is because you have to carry less food and water, not worry too much about getting shower and you still get to see nearly everything that’s out there. I would strongly recommend against staying &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than 3 nights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a stop at Reno at least for a night before heading towards Black Rock City. Besides mini-Las Vegas style environment, you can also visit REI, Walmart and Walgreens to get the gear, water, grocery and so on. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peppermillreno.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pepermill Resort&lt;/a&gt; is where I stayed overnight because it’s cheapest awesome hotel in Reno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A compass is very useful to have to get on the right street when coming back in the night far away from playa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have 3-season camping tent you are probably in trouble. These tents usually have mesh in the walls for ventilation and they have rain fly to protect against rain. This arrangement however is pretty useless to protect against sandstorms. On a typical stormy day I would get about half inch layer of sand inside my 3 season tent and I had to spend an hour every night cleaning things up. Make sure you have duct tapes and things to cover up. Everything outside tent should be tied to rebars so it doesn’t fly away with storms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather at burning man is 110F+. It’s normally not possible to sleep inside the tent after 10 AM. It’s not unusual to stay up until 3 AM. Nights are cold and you will need a fleece jacket. I’d 30 degree rated &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/760252&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt; which was bit warmer but worked fine. BTW, try to bring sleeping bag liner to avoid it getting sweaty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a first timer it might be hard to understand culture of gifts. For example, someone I don’t know at all would give me something and I would be confused if I should really take it. This can spoil the experience for the giver and the taker. Here’s how it works: If someone gives you a gift, take it with a smile without hesitation and give them a gift in return. It’s that simple. The only thing to remember is to bring bunch of gifts that you can easily carry around. Here are some of the examples of gifts: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.123stickers.com/index.asp?PageAction=Custom&amp;amp;ID=68&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Custom stickers&lt;/a&gt; with your favorite quotes, necklaces, bead jewelry, &lt;a href=&#34;http://glowproducts.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;things that glows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1282811182/ref=sr_nr_seeall_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=zimbabwe%20dollars&amp;amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Azimbabwe%20dollars%2Ci%3Amisc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trillion Dollars Notes&lt;/a&gt;, candies, custom printed postcards and so on. A single major mistake first timers make is not to bring gifts to give away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bicycles would be your savior. If you can’t bring from home then rent or steal from Reno. BRC is really huge and you would be lucky if you could walk just one street a day. Most events that I was interested usually were many miles apart and it’s impossible to make it on time without bicycle. Besides you really don’t want to get tired after walking 10 miles just to attend couple of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as you enter gate you will be handed a map and booklet of events. The map is easy to understand because of it’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://earth.burningman.com/brc/2009/map/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;semi-circle streets&lt;/a&gt;. Any location is specified by using hand of clock and name of the street. The 6 o’clock is the center while 2 o’clock and 10 o’clock are two ends of semi-circle. The street names are different every year depending on the theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is NO assigned camping sites at Burning Man (except for theme camps). Normally all except outer two streets are occupied within first couple of days. When I arrived on Wednesday evening I decided to keep as much distance from outer road as possible because that’s where all the cars keep passing by. But I did not wanted to be too inside because the view of vast playa on the outer street is awesome. I also wanted to stay in middle so distance to get on any side is minimized. Always consider if your neighbors have enough space around their tent to put picnic table or chairs or grills or another car. The best space I found on Wednesday night was at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gigapan.org/gigapans/34311/snapshots/161246/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;7:15 and Kinship&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone asks you “which camp are you in?” then that usually means “what is the name of your camp?”. You can consult with your neighbor to decide on some name for group camp and put on the sign. You can also tell the location such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gigapan.org/gigapans/34311/snapshots/161246/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;7:15 &amp;amp; Kinship&lt;/a&gt; like other first timers do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The iPhone &amp;amp; AT&amp;amp;T did worked with full 4 bars at Black Rock City in 2009. It’s really really a good choice to turn it off and resist temptation to tweet/facebook for your entire stay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here’s one of the most disgusting part of my Burning Man experience: The place I choose to camp was up-winds in the path of potty patties. That means every time wind blew even a little it would smell really really bad. It was horrible. Fortunately I came to my tent only to sleep when smell was gone. It’s really worth to make sure you avoid such smelly spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t wear jeans at Burning Man! Many places that do not allow jeans believe that they are too “casual” for them but at Burning Man you don’t want to wear jeans because they would be too “formal”! I wore my normal jeans on first night and felt so out of place and formal that it was embarrassing. If you must wear jeans then take your old jeans, paint them or tear them or whatever. Shorts are semi-casual options at Burning Man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list of events at Burning Man is overwhelming. You do not have to go crazy to attend as many events as possible and it’s best to chose no more than 3 events per day to attend. It’s good idea to reserve one day just sit back at your tent and look at vast playa in mild warm wind :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooking at Burning Man can get tricky because of sandstorms. I’d bought my camping stove which didn’t work out in storms. Fortunately more prepared folks did cooking in their camps and gave away lots of free food. I’d also bought some non-perishable stuff like bananas, milk powder, Sahale snacks, bars, chips and so on. One last option for food is to go back to town via bus or car but that might ruin your experience. Fortunately I did not had that option because I didn’t had car and I never found the bus. One good outcome was that I lost few pounds! Next time I might just buy or rent a grill because it work better in dust storms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I estimated 1.5 gallon of water per day per person and it worked out well for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can meet and greet your neighbors without feeling awkward. When you cook meal, offer some to them. Always have at least two gifts to give away to your two neighbors while departing. Example of gifts are some sketch you made while at Burning Man or other art work or a poem or your favorite book or some photo you took.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, you do need &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/758050&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kitchen sink&lt;/a&gt;! You will need it to brush teeth, wash hands etc. It’s not OK to spill water with soap on playa floor but if your sink is small and soap biodegradable then you would be ok to collect water in it and then go to outer street to flung it away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people do not shower at Burning Man (or so I think). There are few elaborate large camps that set up showers and some even offer them to others as well. But in general, don’t expect showers. Alternative is wet towel to wipe off of your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many camps on inner circle serves free drinks to anyone who wants but you need to bring your own cup. It helps a lot if you have a cup with lid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a place everybody refers to as “The Temple”. It’s located beyond The Man and many first timers would even miss it because they usually don’t go beyond The Man (it’s a LONG walk too). The Temple is truly sacred in many aspects without being connected to even the concept of religion. It’s humbling and even moving to spend a day at the temple. The Temple burns on next day after The Man burns and more spectacularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burning Man usually has 35,000+ people which causes 2 to 4 hours of traffic jams while leaving. While it’s fun to see the parade of every RV ever made, the time with least traffic to leave Burning Man is on Saturday night after The Man burns. But the flip side is that you will miss even more spectacular burn of The Temple which is on Sunday night. Another flip side of leaving on Saturday night is that you run huge risk of falling sleep while driving. When I left on Saturday night I saw at least 3 accidents on the way and so I decided to just pull over and sleep anyway. For my next time, I would be leaving on Monday late afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally here are &lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/sytelus1/BurningMan2009#5509703293720242962&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pictures from my trip&lt;/a&gt; which hopefully would give some idea about what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mountain Weather in Washington</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Usual weather websites do not give you the forecast at a point but rather around some town/city which renders them pretty useless for mountains. Here are the collected links for mountain weather forecasts for Washington:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tomato Firmware for Router and Comcast Cable Modem</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/tomato-firmware-for-router-and-comcast-cable-modem/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2009 07:41:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/tomato-firmware-for-router-and-comcast-cable-modem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a note… if you have Tomato installed as firmware in the router and Comcast cable internet then try followings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnect cable modem and router and wait until their lights go off. For Comcast modem it takes fair bit of time because of internal battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Internet connection is still lost then connect your computer directly to cable modem. If this doesn’t work then you need to call Comcast at 1-800-COMCAST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If above works then the problem is that your router isn’t syncing with cable model. To confirm this, log in to router login page usual &lt;a href=&#34;http://192.168.(0/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://192.168.(0&lt;/a&gt; or 1).1. See the status in overview. If this status is &amp;ldquo;Renewing…&amp;rdquo; and never changes then disconnect cable co-axial wire going to model. Turn off cable model. After all LEDs goes off turn it back on. Reconnect cable co-ax to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Silencing Exceptions in a Little Better Way</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/silencing-exceptions-in-a-little-better-way/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2009 23:54:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/silencing-exceptions-in-a-little-better-way/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the most disastrous code usually takes the following form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;try
{
    //some code
}
catch
{ }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silencing exceptions is almost never good but sometime the problem is minor and you don’t want want to blow up and call for an exit. However wouldn’t it be better if exceptions don’t remain silent and scream for your attention when you are debugging and behave less aggressively otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about if we can replace above code with following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cs&#34;&gt;IgnoreExceptionButNotIfDebugging(() =&amp;gt;
{
    //some code
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mysterious IgnoreExceptionButNotIfDebugging is a simple method that takes lambda and it would look like below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static void IgnoreExceptionButNotIfDebugging(Action codeBlockToExecute)
{
    try
    {
        codeBlockToExecute();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        if (Debugger.IsAttached)
            Debugger.Break();

        Trace.Write(&#34;Exception occured: &#34; + ex.Message);

        EventLog.WriteEntry(&#34;MyApp&#34;, ex.Message, EventLogEntryType.Warning);

#if DEBUG
            throw;
#endif
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can surround any of your code by IgnoreExceptionButNotIfDebugging and make sure things don’t remain silent when you are debugging!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Best Culture Invariant Format for DateTime</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/the-best-culture-invariant-format-for-datetime/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2009 01:35:41 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/the-best-culture-invariant-format-for-datetime/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to display how to display DateTime as text without causing confusion to users in different countries then good choices is either &amp;ldquo;o&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;ldquo;o&amp;rdquo; format is in general more preferable as it also puts timezone offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;long t = DateTime.Now.Ticks;
Console.WriteLine((new DateTime(t)).ToString(&#34;o&#34;));
Console.WriteLine((new DateTime(t, DateTimeKind.Local)).ToString(&#34;o&#34;));
Console.WriteLine((new DateTime(t, DateTimeKind.Unspecified)).ToString(&#34;o&#34;));
Console.WriteLine((new DateTime(t, DateTimeKind.Utc)).ToString(&#34;o&#34;));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prints followings when actual date time is 2009-11-08T17:16:13.7791953 PST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;2009-11-08T17:16:13.7791953
2009-11-08T17:16:13.7791953-08:00
2009-11-08T17:16:13.7791953
2009-11-08T17:16:13.7791953Z
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo; instead it would print followings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;Sun, 08 Nov 2009 17:26:02 GMT
Sun, 08 Nov 2009 17:26:02 GMT
Sun, 08 Nov 2009 17:26:02 GMT
Sun, 08 Nov 2009 17:26:02 GMT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Find Path of a Command Line Tool</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/find-path-of-a-command-line-tool/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2009 23:06:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/find-path-of-a-command-line-tool/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many times you work on different machines, execute a command line tool but often wonder where that tool is actually installed. One way to figure this out is to look at all environment PATH variables and search them manually in same order as Windows does. But you don’t have to because luckily there is a little known built-in command called WHERE that does that for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2009/10/image_8.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to Unix commands like WHICH and WHEREIS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What’s in a name?</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/whats-in-a-name/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2009 03:32:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/whats-in-a-name/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you want to store the name of a person a typical design starts out by creating two fields (in database or class):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;First Name
Last Name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon you realize lot of people have middle name, especially, when name change occurs after marriages. So you go and add one more field:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;First Name
Middle Name 
Last Name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all good… until you encounter people in countries such as Spain and Cuba who have custom to have two last names. Both are equally important and both are required in any official document (including ones your website or app may print out). So you go in and add one more field while thinking this ought to do it once and for all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;First Name
Middle Name 
Last Name
2nd Last Name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so fast… Lot of people from Hong Kong and few other places in Asia actually carry two first names. One of these first names is traditional while other is typically a Western/Roman name. Both first names are important and often many people will know only Western/Roman first name of a person although official documents would only refer to traditional names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider name of Hong Kong’s Chief Secretary &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anson_Chan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Anson Chan Fang On Sang&lt;/a&gt;. Here Anson is English given name, On Sang is Chinese given name, Chan is husband’s surname and Fang is her own surname.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So time to add few more field so we can store everybody’s names on planet without loss of semantics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;Traditional Given Name
English Given Name
Middle Name 
Last Name
2nd Last Name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok… so are we done now? Well, almost! We are still missing at least two critical pieces of information: Salutation and Suffix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of common salutations are Dr, Mr, Mrs, Mr. While salutations are quickly falling out of fashion it might be still required, for example, if you are printing out an official letter to your customer and don’t want to make it look very casual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of common suffixes are Jr, Sr, III, IV etc. These are required in official/legal communication to avoid confusion with other family members of a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;Salutation
Traditional Given Name
English Given Name
Middle Name 
Last Name
2nd Last Name
Suffix
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have covered most of the globe. There are still two more nice-to-have fields if you want to make your customers happy: Phonetic Given Name and Phonetic Last Name. Remember the times when you call customer support and each time you have a guy struggling to say your name? These two fields would avoid those moments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;Salutation
Traditional Given Name
English Given Name
Middle Name 
Last Name
2nd Last Name
Phonetic Given Name
Phonetic Last Name
Suffix
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. A structure that can store almost anybody’s name on planet while maintaining semantics of each component of a name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most applications won’t need to go to this extreme because it’s OK to just have one first name and one last name that correctly identifies a person for its purpose even if it’s culturally incorrectly and technically incomplete. However if you are in a business where legal implications are high or if any information loss about your customer is not tolerable then it’s good to think about these possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably better solutions than giant structure like above just to store name of a person. Instead of having all these different fields you can simply have one free form field, say, Full Name and another field called Full Name Style which takes values indicating how different components of names are arranged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;Full Name
Full Name Style
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This structure will make searches for specific components of a name little difficult but it would extend well as your application grows around the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Snoqualmie Falls Hike Analysis</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/snoqualmie-falls-hike-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2009 09:09:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/snoqualmie-falls-hike-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was perhaps my 32nd hike at Snoqualmie Falls. I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted this trail as my daily hike routine. Today I brought my new Garmin Oregon 400t GPS with me and recorded the track. Fortunately there is a website (although not that good) called MotionBased which can slice and dice and analyze this track data and tell you lot of cool things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the MotionBased&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/invitation/dashboard.mb?episodePk.pkValue=7658501&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;analysis of Snoqualmie Falls hike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few interesting things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a 1.4 miles hike with 475 ft elevation gain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hike takes about 35 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ascent and descent speeds as well as times are roughly same (note that I do not made any stops except at ends of the trail).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My speed while ascending is 2.4 mph and vertical speed is 14 ft/min or 840 ft/hr. Not too bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This hike has average grade of 16%. This is just 1% more than max allowed by typical gym treadmills. At steepest point the trail is 30% grade while about the &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; max limit on typical maintained trails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using my watch which can measure elevation I thought that was 300ft elevation hike. Obviously my watch can easily be 100ft off. Here&amp;rsquo;s the elevation profile of this hike:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Treadmill Grade to Angle Conversion</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/treadmill-grade-to-angle-conversion/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2009 08:02:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/treadmill-grade-to-angle-conversion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gym machines like treadmills and even some roads express the slop as &amp;ldquo;grade&amp;rdquo; in percentage. For example, most gym treadmills allow up to 15% grade. I&amp;rsquo;ve left going to gym since last few months and instead I&amp;rsquo;m doing this Snoqualmie Falls hike almost every other day (which is 0.5 miles one way and 300ft elevation). But occasionally I have to go to gym because of early sunsets. I usually put max grade (15%) and speed walk for one mile burning 350 cal. So naturally the question is how many feet I climbed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this I need to convert grade in % to angle. But what is &amp;ldquo;grade%&amp;rdquo;? Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s ration of rise/run or in other words,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#39;text-align:center;&#39;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_a70e32da0fd6a1130b81e5a875b5c5e3.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none;&#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;grade=\frac{tan(\theta)}{100}&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So your vertical climb in feet is given by, &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_911bbf0a2826cdbec9aee7568639f9c3.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; &#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;\sin(\tan^{-1}(grade*100))*5280&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; miles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by that calculation, at maximum grade on gym treadmill I climb 783.2 feet for each mile I walk. Not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Via conversation &lt;a href=&#34;http://forum.onlineconversion.com/showthread.php?t=7377&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the best time to hike Zion Narrows?</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/what-is-the-best-time-to-hike-zion-narrows/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2009 12:14:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/what-is-the-best-time-to-hike-zion-narrows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I LOVE slot canyons and Zion Narrows hike is something on my To-do for very long time since I saw it in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=60029430&amp;amp;trkid=222336&amp;amp;lnkctr=srchrd-sr&amp;amp;strkid=2061597409_0_0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Zion_Canyon_Treasure_of_the_Gods_IMAX/60000565?trkid=222336&amp;amp;lnkctr=srchrd-sr&amp;amp;strkid=1473599445_0_0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IMAX&lt;/a&gt;. So when I saw this deal from Southwest about 50% off on all travels my first thought was to book tickets to Las Vegas (nearest to Zion) or SLC. Due to restriction on this deal the travel needs to be completed by May 31st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question: Is last week of May the best time to do Zion Narrows? I&amp;rsquo;ve fanatically looked for answer all over and here&amp;rsquo;s the summary. Disclaimer: that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been there so all these research comes from web, not my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My criteria for &amp;ldquo;best time&amp;rdquo; is fairly simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid wearing dry/wet suit to do this hike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid wading in 1ft of water for miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pleasant 70s temperature that allows good other hikes like Angel&amp;rsquo;s Landing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several websites have various opinions on &amp;ldquo;best time&amp;rdquo;. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zionadventures.com/best_seasons_to_hike_the_narrows.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;top Google hit&lt;/a&gt; puts up a table indicating May, June and Septembers are the best. This is way too fuzzy answer because early May is actually as worse as April and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you different late May really is compared to late June. Yes, there is a big difference!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, other websites gets more specific and tells you late June and late September is the best time. We are getting closer to a specific answer but still no data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lot of searching I finally hit the pot of gold:&lt;a href=&#34;http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ut/nwis/dv?cb_00060=on&amp;amp;cb_00065=on&amp;amp;format=gif_default&amp;amp;begin_date=2008-01-01&amp;amp;end_date=2009-01-01&amp;amp;site_no=09405500&amp;amp;referred_module=sw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;USGA Water Data&lt;/a&gt;! This website has exact numbers for CFS (cubic foot per second) and gage height data for each day all the way back to 1988. The rules are quite simple: anything below 50 CFS is easy and 250 FS is too much. The USGA has done fantastic job in presenting this data on website. For example, here you can see CFS levels for 2008:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverDischarge.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverDischarge.png&#34; alt=&#34;NorthForkVirginRiverDischarge&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;384&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-733&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverDischarge.png 576w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverDischarge-300x200.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can see late May is not all that good but it is rapidly getting better over entire June although it takes all of the June before we get 40 CFS. This means late June is pretty good time to go but difference between early June and late June is almost two fold! Then notice all those spikes in early July. My guess is those are flash floods or thunderstorms. On other hand look how stable mid-end September is! We get 30 CFS almost all month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverGageHeight.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverGageHeight.png&#34; alt=&#34;NorthForkVirginRiverGageHeight&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;384&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-732&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverGageHeight.png 576w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverGageHeight-300x200.png 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are looking at about foot of water at May end and about quarter of that in mid-end September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise you can go through charts for may years back. It obviously varies from year to year. For example, year 2007 had very low stable CFS at end of May unlike rapidly decreasing high levels of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years worth of charts that I checked &lt;strong&gt;one theme emerges: mid to end September has most stable and low CFS!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how about temperatures? Here&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wunderground.com/NORMS/DisplayNORMS.asp?AirportCode=KCDC&amp;amp;SafeCityName=Zion_National_Park&amp;amp;StateCode=UT&amp;amp;Units=none&amp;amp;IATA=CDC&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Weather Underground&amp;rsquo;s seasonal average feature&lt;/a&gt; helps! Here is the seasonal averages weather graph for Zion National Park:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverWeather.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverWeather.png&#34; alt=&#34;NorthForkVirginRiverWeather&#34; width=&#34;462&#34; height=&#34;687&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-731&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverWeather.png 462w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/NorthForkVirginRiverWeather-201x300.png 201w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the temperature in mid-September is pleasant 70s just like in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So there you have it! Mid September to September end (2nd and 3rd weeks of September) is the best time to go to Zion National Park and Narrows. That&amp;rsquo;s when you are most likely to get stable low water levels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mount Si - Take #2</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/mount-si-take-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2009 02:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/mount-si-take-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I tried Mount Si hike again and returned back before I saw &amp;ldquo;Snag Flats&amp;rdquo;, second time. Snag Flats are supposed to somewhere between 1300&amp;rsquo; to 1500&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively small hike that you can do in 2-3 hours (full hike to summit of Mount Si is a long 8 hour 3200&amp;rsquo; climb). Today because of heavily packed wet snow it was extremely slippery. Many people even had crampons on. People who did not had any &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ems.com/catalog/subcategory_simple.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302879862&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;traction devices&lt;/a&gt; (like me) had very hard time to go up on slippery trail and even harder time to come down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not do this trail without wearing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rei.com/product/774966&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kahtoola Microspikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I&amp;rsquo;d to turn back at1250&amp;rsquo; because I&amp;rsquo;d started too late and it was getting dark. Today I got up to 1440&amp;rsquo; but still saw no sign of so called snag flats or a view point where Mailbox peak and Mt Rainier can be seen. But then I suddenly realized that I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten my camera on the trail during last water break! So I went down to look for it but didn&amp;rsquo;t found it. I finally got down in parking lot and walked there for quite sometime looking for any lost &amp;amp; found places (&lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=104533212117189621673.00044d8c694b6da7eb931&amp;amp;ll=47.496618,-121.732464&amp;amp;spn=0.031315,0.090637&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;z=14&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mount Si trailhead&lt;/a&gt; has HUGE parking lot and somehow there are always dozen cars there). Several people were coming down or going up but no one had seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then an amazing thing happened. Just when I was driving out the parking lot and I was almost out, I decided to stop for a minute and put up a sticky note. And I suddenly saw 3 guys coming down and they had &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=11592&amp;amp;pq-locale=en_US&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my camera&lt;/a&gt;! It was just a matter of few seconds and I would have left. Thank you strangers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Those 3 guys mentioned that they were going to return it to ranger station. So next time if you loose something always check with ranger station or forest service.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, for us in mid-northern latitudes (and especially Seattle weather), things won&amp;rsquo;t be as bright and high but having these objects &amp;ldquo;collide&amp;rdquo; with each other and that too with crescent moon around looks beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This addictive program can easily keep you busy for rest of the weekend so be careful :). &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phun.at/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Phun&lt;/a&gt; is a physics simulator that even kids can use and its absolutely a delight. I watched the video and had to immediately download to give it a try. At first the interface might seem not as easy but after reading tutorial in main page and forums, you might be able to accomplish everything shown in video in less than 15 min of learning curve! Simply the easiest, powerful and most fun physics program I’ve come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing DSS</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/introducing-dss/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:04:01 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are tons and tons of things to blog but here is a quick one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Thanksgiving (a 4 days of holidays in USA) I wanted to work on something really cool that is absolutely worth doing and something I can spend my entire 4 days continuosly. I looked over my list of pending projects to find something extraordinarily cool, kept thinking about new ideas flowing around, looked over to other idea websites and realized that my mind was just keept going blank all the while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when people asked what were my plans for thanksgiving, I&amp;rsquo;d reply &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing Project Blank&amp;rdquo; :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just so happened, at the very start of the thanksgiving I was casualy reading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SSE specs&lt;/a&gt; that was just announced by Ray Ozzie and immediately realized things missing in there and the huge possibilities of massive human collaboration that it can make happen. Rest of it is the story. I ended up spending about 16 hours a day in designing what I call now Data Syndication Services specifications and writing a reference application for it. While my efforts were inspired by SSE and Groove, the DSS design enables data sharing on a massive scale on much realistic grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what, I still call the project binaries Blank :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to take a look? Go ahead and collaborate &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/dss&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on my GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that you have lived so many years, each having so many days, there&amp;rsquo;s question: How many times you have stood up, raised your head, seen the stars and felt nothing? Well, think twice. You&amp;rsquo;d just popped up your head out of your small tiny ridiculously insignificant world in to something that&amp;rsquo;s stunningly vast and breathtakingly beautiful. Astronomy has been a favorite passion for few of the us fortunate beings since ages and the lesser beings now need not left behind. While I&amp;rsquo;m still writing the page for plain beginners, here are the things you can do right how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star parties is a gathering of few crazy people who wants to do all night long sky watching and help others out in knowing it better! &lt;a href=&#34;http://skyandtelescope.com/resources/calendar/&#34; title=&#34;Sky and Telescope magazine&#39;s Star Party calender&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Check out the events happening in your area&lt;/a&gt; and give yourself a go!.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Groove Hacks</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/groove-hacks/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2005 05:48:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/groove-hacks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year and half ago, the new version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/astrila/messageexport/&#34;&gt;Groove&lt;/a&gt; had came out and it still didn&amp;rsquo;t had an ability export IMs. It drove me nuts so I started to write my own Groove tool that would do it in excuse to explore its infamous internals. Ah! What a ride that was! Groove APIs have extremely huge surface area (which means there are thousands and thousands of them sprinkled all over in hard to find places). Tons of them have confusing names, misleading functionalities and put in the wrong place. The fun part? There is almost no documentation! And yeah, did I forgot to mention that they are heavy C++ oriented, frequently late bound and mostly proprietary stuff (they even have their own proprietary definition for rich text and APIs!)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your brain needs some challenge that&amp;rsquo;s the place to dig in to. After sacrificing my 3 weekends I finally had a working tool that exports Groove IMs and put them to Outlook without loosing formatting or attachments! I consider this an equivalent feat of removing nag dialog of WinZip by changing a x86 jump instruction in its disassembled binary using only Visual Studio debugger and absolutely nothing else ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool had been sitting on my hard drive crying to get out for months and months. In between, I did some polishing up, adding wizards, support for Word and Excel, creating a help file and even created a website for it. So now I think it’s pretty much ready and have decided to give it away for free personal use (similar tools cost $50 something I guess). &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/astrila/messageexport/&#34;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt; if you use Groove and want to save your invaluable messages! Call it laziness or ignorance or whatever but I really do feel guilty not to putting this out early when 3.0 came out and lot of people SO need it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; the (big) news time: We have moved out to all the way to&amp;nbsp;the opposite&amp;nbsp;coast and I&amp;rsquo;ve started my new work at Microsoft! More details will follow as I get some time from double pressure of moving and brand new job but suffice to say that Microsoft is possibly the ultimate geek destination on the planet and it shows up in&amp;nbsp;all kind of&amp;nbsp;little things.&amp;nbsp;Microsoft technologies are driven to its maximum at the MS campuses and its perhaps the best showcase for the power of these technologies.&amp;nbsp;In other news, the fall colors in Seattle area is much vivid and really bright from what &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/photos/111712720654017421562/albums/5987169936526895089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I used to see on east coast&lt;/a&gt; and something we&amp;nbsp;thought we would be missing at&amp;nbsp;this Evergreen State ;).

      <title>Hurricane Formations</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/hurricane-formations/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2005 05:40:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/hurricane-formations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since yesterday night the question how Hurricane comes in to existence was eating me away. I resisted googling it and try to find the answer just for the fun. My instinct was that it must all come down to 2nd law of Thermodynamics (as always!). That means if there is high pressure somewhere, the inherent consequence would be to nullify the excess and have an equal average pressure everywhere. So I was mulling over kind of pressure patterns that would be required to ultimately cause slow rotations that we see on a hurricane. I planned out a little computer simulation of this with the guess that a ring of low pressure would probably produce hurricane-like whirlpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, aha! I was dead wrong. It turns out that the 2nd law actually &lt;em&gt;prevents&lt;/em&gt; cyclones from happening! My wife intuitively pointed out that hurricane would occur due to warm air that goes up where the cold air is but while it does so, the Coriolis effect kicks in which would produce whirlpool (similar to the whirlpool produced when flushing the toilet). Her intuition is awesomely right. All hurricanes in northern hemisphere go in anti-clockwise and southern hemisphere in clockwise. The huge power that a hurricane demonstrate is supplied by rotation of the Earth which itself is so massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also intrigued by how hurricanes are named. It turns out some international committee has preset list of names starting with letter A,B, C.. for each year. The list repeats every 6 years (i.e. names for 2005 hurricanes would be same as 2011). While now many names used are male’s names, previously only female names were used to name hurricanes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/google-logo-headers-max-age/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The response headers returns with Google&amp;rsquo;s logo looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;Content-Type: image/gif
Last-Modified: Mon, 25 Apr 2005 21:06:18 GMT

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for some gif served by IIS on Win 2003 Server looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block code-text&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;no-highlight&#34;&gt;Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0
X-Powered-By: ASP.NET

Etag: &#34;20bb944a9a20c51:acc&#34;

&lt;p&gt;You can get this by using Web Developer Toolbar&amp;rsquo;s Information &amp;gt; Reponse Header button in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting things are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google is not using Cache-Control: max-age=xxxx header which tells browser to cach the image for a while and not re-request from the server again. This is surprising because you would think Google would use every possible way out there to reduce the load on their server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has named their custom web server as Google Web Server, not surprisingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BNL certainly has some scientific lyrics. The &amp;ldquo;Pavlov&amp;rsquo;s dog&amp;rdquo; mentioned in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/barenaked-ladies/13335.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brian Wilson&lt;/a&gt; is about the classic experiment conducted by Pavlov in 1900s to show that dogs can learn to associate ringing of bell to the arrival of food and keep salivate even if you stop giving food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, &amp;ldquo;Nine-point-eight straight down&amp;rdquo; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/barenaked-ladies/13331.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;When I Fall&lt;/a&gt; is the Earth&amp;rsquo;s gravitational constant &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; when an object freely falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;rsquo;t possibly better ways writing about science experiments in more artistic ways in mainstream songs 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Cool .Net Nuggets</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/some-cool-net-nuggets/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2005 22:00:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/some-cool-net-nuggets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If type&amp;rsquo;s constructor (i.e. static constructor) throws an exception, entire type becomes unusable. Any attempt to call any member of that type would result in TypeInitializationException.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operator overloading should never be the only way to use the functionality if your code targets 1.x versions of frameworks because VB.Net can&amp;rsquo;t access it without resorting to ugly calls such as &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;op_Addition&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is universal symbol for money (a generic version of $, £, ¥ etc) and it&amp;rsquo;s ¤ (U+00A4). If you format the number as currency in culture invariant way then .net attaches this symbol to your number. I just think it&amp;rsquo;s cool to have some universal symbol for money :).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplest way to convert hex number to int: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Int32.Parse(&amp;ldquo;1AFF&amp;rdquo;, NumberStyles.HexNumber, null)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplest way to display array of bytes as hex values: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;BitConverter.ToString(byteArray)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you updated something in your computer and suddenly your .Net app behaves bad, it is possible to do automatic rollback.. The .Net Framework keeps track of assemblies that was loaded by any managed app up. This info is stored in an INI file in &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;LocalSettings\Application Data\ApplicationHistory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and is used by .Net Application Restore tool. I think this great debugging aid too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In .Net world, zombies are not purely an imagination: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class Person
{
static object HoldOnToMe;
~Person()
{
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;HoldOnToMe = this;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
    GC.ReRegisterForFinalize(this);
}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Values types are allocated on stack but not when you have an array of value types. For example, &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;new Int32[100]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;allocates 100 unboxed integers on heap, not on stack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Finally block is not really always guaranteed to get executed. If any of these 3 special exceptions do happen, code in Finally won&amp;rsquo;t be executed: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OutOfMemoryException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;StackOverFlowException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExecutionEngineException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;d be fortunate enough to experience all of these). That means you had created some global kernel objects, they will indeed hang around and may interfere when user restarts your app. BTW, if you see a code like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;catch(Exception ex) {...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;catch{...}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                

&lt;p&gt;, tell the developer that he has committed a sin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently GC.Collect() is not always a line of code you should disgust at. You might want to do it especially when you &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; the process and had created loads of objects which won&amp;rsquo;t be used any further (for example moving on to a new tab in WinForms app). I used this in one of my projects to improve on the memory pressure and was really feeling guilty about it, until recently. &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;        GC.Collect();
//block my thread till objects needing finalization are done
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
GC.Collect();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should always strong name your assemblies, especially if it is going to be used by assemblies in multiple AppDomains in the same process because only they are shared between domains; otherwise each AppDomain will have it&amp;rsquo;s own copy. Why anyone would have multiple AppDomains, you ask. Well, if you are enabling your app to have 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party plugins, I strongly recommend loading all these plugins in to a separate domain. This way not only you can control the security policy on these plugins but also unload the bad plugins without shutting down your app. This is often overlooked in various plugin architectures for .Net but if you don&amp;rsquo;t do this, you app might go on the same route as IE6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have enabled your app or website for localization, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to test it with Turkish language. If your thread is having CurrentCulture Turkish (tr-TR) and if you try to uppercase a letter i, you get 0 instead of normal english I (i.e. Unicode character U+0130 instead of U+0049). Scott Hanselman has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UpdateOnTheDasBlogTurkishIBugAndAReminderToMeOnGlobalization.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a first hand experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you know Application.ThreadException event which lets you capture the unhandled exceptions in WinForms app and do something like Windows Error Reporting. But the better way is probably &lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AppDomain.UnhandledException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;event because that also lets you get notified for non-CLS compliant exceptions and without needing a reference to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-inline&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
                    

&lt;p&gt;object.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The values of public constants that you reference from other assemblies are embedded in your own assembly metadata. That means, if other assembly changes the value of the constant afterwards, you must recompile your own assembly or otherwise you still will be using that old value of the constant. I think this is as critical &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/27597&#34; title=&#34;My post on OT list about how troublesome this problem could be&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lapsed event handlers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jagged arrays are not CLS compliant. If you are building a library that can be used by VB or C# guys, you can&amp;rsquo;t have jagged arrays as public member type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Basic can do this: &lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Try
&amp;hellip;
Catch e as Exception &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;When x = 0&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;
&amp;hellip;
End try
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Digits Of Pi</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/digits-of-pi/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2005 20:20:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/digits-of-pi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A famous quote from John Von Neumann goes like this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve intuitively believed since I was 15 and even hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of Neumann. Pure random numbers is (or probably more) as fascinating concept as &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_7ed9abff4dafd78d08e616c899412e92.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:2px;&#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;\infty&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:1px;&#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;i&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It is impossible to generate sequence of purely random numbers without tapping in to nature. That means I could never write a computer code that generates a sequence of random numbers without showing up absolutely any patterns in a long run. There are only better random generators, never a perfect one, except thy nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I saw an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010901/bob9.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that digits of Pi are so far empirically proven to be randomly distributed, I was shocked. Infect &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nersc.gov/%7Edhbailey/dhbpapers/bcrandom.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;huge progress&lt;/a&gt; has been made to prove that digits of Pi are indeed randomly distributed. Now the fact is, p can indeed be calculated algebraically (i.e. without tapping in to any natural phenomenon) and the idea that this can produce a pure random distribution just gives me a feeling as if sky is falling. I&amp;rsquo;d been hypothesizing since long time that the ability to generate infinite sequence of pure random numbers is the most significant (and probably the only) property to identify the existence of &lt;em&gt;real universe,&lt;/em&gt; if it at all exist, that is ;). Consider this question: How do you know, at this precise moment, that you aren&amp;rsquo;t part of some simulation running on some huge alien computer, or that you aren&amp;rsquo;t some character in StarTrek holosuit or that you aren&amp;rsquo;t dreaming with all these things around you (however &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; they may feel) aren&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo;? Ok, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain what I&amp;rsquo;m asking you but in nutshell, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find out from pure mathematical perspective if there is anything in the nature that I can&amp;rsquo;t masquerade, a property of the physical world around us that is impossible to simulate by any artificial means however sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis is that this property of the real world is an ability to generate infinite sequence of pure random numbers. That means, if you really want to find out whether you are some simulation running in a giant alien computer, all you have to do is to observe some natural phenomenon over a time with precision P and verify that your readings demonstrate pure randomness over the period of time T, where the P and T depends on sophistication of that alien simulation. The P and T can be very large but can never be infinity, except unless you are in the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; world, of course. This is the mathematician&amp;rsquo;s version of &amp;ldquo;I exist because I think&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you know why randomness of digits of pi made my stomach cringe. When I think about it, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel that any &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TranscendentalNumber.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;transcendental number&lt;/a&gt; obtained through convergence of infinite series (lets call them algebric transcendentals or ATs) must indeed have its digits distributed randomly. If you remember Cantor, there are more transcendental numbers than any other kind. But what this really means is I&amp;rsquo;m able to generate sequence of &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; random numbers only using algebric means. It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as finding new AT and emitting its digits. If you were someone who had given lot of thoughts to the nature of random numbers for years, this would sound both frightening and exciting to you. But hold on, could this really be true? After giving this some thought I believe it couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly be. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally constructed the following conjecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a finite sequence of minimum length &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; of digits of any AT, there exist a Turing machine program &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_ea71ebbff62198aa6264a9da7b39d1f5.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; &#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;G(L)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to calculate the next digit in that sequence in finite steps. In other words, for any AT there always exist a number &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; which is finite and for which &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_ea71ebbff62198aa6264a9da7b39d1f5.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; &#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;G(L)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComputableFunction.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;computable function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple language, if you just give me sequence of AT&amp;rsquo;s digits I should be able to &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; the next digits provided you gave me enough of them to start with. This simply means if the alien computer was trieng to fool you by feeding you digits of some AT as a stream of random numbers, you can just sit back, collect these digits for a while and when you get handful of those, you can run through your algorithm to predict the next digits and find out you are not really in a real world (and also the fact that aliens didn&amp;rsquo;t knew about Shital&amp;rsquo;s AT Conjecture)! So random distribution is not the one and only property to identify a sequence of pure random numbers. The sequence of pure random numbers would not satisfy this conjecture (i.e. &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; would be 8). Infect this should be outright obvious: For sequence of natural numbers &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_95367d3bc0a72098fbf5e8eb9ee62b23.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; &#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;0, 1, 2, \ldots&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we have all digits equally distributed but this sequence isn&amp;rsquo;t by any means random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also gets us on to something else: the &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; now becomes a valuable property of an AT. A random number with infinite digits can be considered as a special class of AT with &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_be99be7086bdc9d1844b5d182145e847.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:1px;&#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;L\approx&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\infty&lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; &#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s call set of all such number &lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; (greek capital letter Rho) then the cardinality of &lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d2606be4e0cd2c9a6179c8f2e3547a85.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:2px;&#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;\rho&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; should be _&lt;a href=&#34;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Aleph-1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;MathJax_Preview&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_1ec91515d3d64d3f7811f9d115134b0c.gif&#39; style=&#39;vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:1px;&#39; class=&#39;tex&#39; alt=&#34;\aleph&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;_.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all of this went over your head, here is fun part: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.angio.net/pi/piquery&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can look it up if your phone number has showed up in digits of pi calculated so far or &lt;a href=&#34;http://pi.nersc.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;even your name&lt;/a&gt; expressed as hex codes! For example, I can be found in pi at 67357954&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digit ;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use the sieve method for twin primes to obtain the relationship for the twin prime counting function same as that was conjectured by Hardy and Littlewood but without making their heuristic assumption about the prime number distribution. Later we generalize our method to get the expression for the counting function for prime pairs (n, n+2k) and show that it is again same as the extended Goldbach conjecture that was conjectured by Hardy and Littlewood.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>15 Questions On Leadership</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/15-questions-on-leadership/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are interesting questions if you were pursuing an acadamy degree on management/leadership. I do have the answers but don&amp;rsquo;t have enough room here to write it down (&lt;a href=&#34;http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.fermat.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fermat&lt;/a&gt; R.I.P.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a good leader should do when a majority vote is different then his/her strongly held belief?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you must make a choice between hurting your team&amp;rsquo;s goal or ethics, what a good leader should choose?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say your boss wants you and your team to do something that isn&amp;rsquo;t good for your team&amp;rsquo;s goals. After lots of arguments, your boss does not change his/her mind. How would you handle this situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a good leader should treat his/her equals in the team? What can you do to harness his/her abilities without producing conflicts in leadership or ego-clash?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a good leader would pass the unpleasant news to the team without hurting the morals and motivation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In certain phase of a project you need your team to heavily overwork for a some period. What are the good things to do to keep the team alive and motivated in such times?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some members of a large team may end up doing boring, repetitive and otherwise uninteresting work. How a good leader would recruit them? How to keep them motivated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistically 90% of the projects goes over-budget and over-deadlines. Say if you did fell in to these 90%, how would you keep your boss and your team keep going?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication is of atmost important to the team. But is it good or bad to have lots of discussions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the good rules of thumb for good signal-to-noise ratio for team brainstorming sessions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A very capable and essential team member of yours asks you for a raise but you do not have funds. How would you keep him/her?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say you lead a large team and you can&amp;rsquo;t recruit every single team member personally any longer. What are the general good recruiting policies a leader can set up avoid the weak nodes in your team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you had to choose between following two candidates, what job attributes you would consider for the best match? enthusiastic but inexperienced college grads and less passionate but highly experienced professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a good leader should respond when he/she finds certain team members does not respect or have a belief in him/her?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lets say you came to knew that you might soon become the target for certain mishaps, which weren&amp;rsquo;t really your fault. What would be your exit strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea of wrapping calendar information in to the RSS feed may sound very appealing. Almost every website owned by some kind of group or organization has their event calendar. The thought that you can aggregate them in to your &amp;ldquo;Calendar Aggregator&amp;rdquo; is just so geekily cool. What if people started putting up their weekend plans through some kind of RSS-Calendar and you can subscribe to them in your calendar program! I dig through dozens of W3C and other specs and half a dozen of implementation to find out what has been done so far and why it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet. The result of my findings and possible solution are summarized in &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/integrating-rss-and-calendar/&#34;&gt;my essay&lt;/a&gt; in some reader friendly writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really engaging book. It will take you to the journey of just few microseconds after the big bang, the sequence of events for next few minutes and how everything came to existance. It&amp;rsquo;s not baseless as it may sound, there is tons of mathematics behind every conclusion. Even more engaging is the discussion why we should bother about this? The book is slim and probably the best in astrophysics ever written for a layman! &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553103741/102-3263321-6040950&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;More on this book&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots and lots of books written on mathematics claiming to target mass audience and containing none to minimal &amp;ldquo;mathematics&amp;rdquo;. You read these kind out of books and when you turn last page, you ask yourself what was really going on all the way? Well this book is different and if you ask me, it&amp;rsquo;s the best book on mathematics I&amp;rsquo;ve came across. It&amp;rsquo;s collection of few not-too-obvious theorems derived from scratch with it&amp;rsquo;s histories and uses and stories. It&amp;rsquo;s the way math textbooks should have been written. And it&amp;rsquo;s so good, I hate to say I&amp;rsquo;ve found any other book that&amp;rsquo;s come even near to this one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay reviews several efforts made to represent calendar information, ways to publish and subscribe event listing and efforts that have been made towards extending RSS for this purpose. It points out difficulties in implementing the standards and proposes a solution. &lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; May 23, 2005 &lt;strong&gt;Last Updated&lt;/strong&gt;: June 2, 2005 &lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ShitalShah.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shital Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-idea&#34;&gt;The Idea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every website owned by an organization or a group has some kind of event listing. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool if those websites could publish these event listing through some kind of feed which users can consume and aggregate right in to their calendars? In this essay, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss just that. There are several scenarios where this technology could be a blessing. For instance, you may be able to subscribe to your friend&amp;rsquo;s schedules and also to your office meetings. You can subscribe to ticket-master concerts dates or university symposiums or hike schedule from your local outdoor club or keep track of IMAX movies at your favorite theater. The essence of the idea is to unify all types of event listings in to a common machine readable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; subscribable format so that your calendar program can keep itself updated automatically. Because of its popularity, RSS would obviously come to ones mind when one think about publishing and aggregating something. However we&amp;rsquo;ll see that the RSS is neither the only vehicle nor an ideal one for calendar feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-calendar-standards&#34;&gt;The Calendar Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the basics: Are there any standards at all for exchanging calendar information? According to some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/0000149.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;, oldest one and still widely used is called vCalendar which is simply a plain text property-set type format. This specification was refined by IETF in the &amp;lsquo;90s and renamed as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iCalendar&lt;/a&gt; (iCal for short). They kept the same text format as vCalendar because back then XML specs weren&amp;rsquo;t up yet and people hadn&amp;rsquo;t started craving for everything wrapped in angle brackets. Over the years iCalendar has became really popular even though it was pretty complex to fully implement it. Today, most calendar programs support iCalendar format at some extent and you can often find the data stored in this format in files with ics extension. However the biggest surge of iCal usage arrived when Apple decided to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; it in its OS X. Apple&amp;rsquo;s iCal app allowed users not only to exchange their calendars but also &lt;em&gt;subscribe&lt;/em&gt; to it! This essentially meant that the app would poll for updates to the iCal files hosted on the webservers at regular interval and automatically keep the user&amp;rsquo;s calendar updated. In my view this is one of the coolest things they have done in recent years and no wonder websites like &lt;iCalShare.com&gt; sprung up overnight and made available thousands of calendars for free for all kind of event listings you could imagine: from Roman Holidays to Beach Nudist events to outdoor performances in Central Park. Apple users can subscribe to these schedules with a single click in their calendars. Even though websites such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://upcoming.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Upcoming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://evdb.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Evdb&lt;/a&gt; supports iCal more than any other format, the &amp;ldquo;calendar subscription&amp;rdquo; revolution has remained more or less contained in tiny Mac users world. Outside of that world, most people don&amp;rsquo;t even know that you can do that kind of stuff. Microsoft didn&amp;rsquo;t seemed very interested (or shell we say, &lt;em&gt;horrendously slow&lt;/em&gt; ) to include this community style feature in Outlook. Infect Outlook did such a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scheduleworld.com/outlookInteroperability.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bad job&lt;/a&gt; with iCal files that it&amp;rsquo;s a shame for such massively touted Office suite. For instance, you can&amp;rsquo;t even import perfectly valid standard iCal file if it had more than one event. However you can download &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mozilla Calendar&lt;/a&gt; extension for Firefox or a standalone version of it called Sunbird and start using iCal files but both of these are at really primitive state right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;did-you-said-it-s-not-xml&#34;&gt;Did You Said It&amp;rsquo;s Not XML?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the XML specs got released in 1998, there begun a race to pack everything inside the angle brackets and poor old iCal wasn&amp;rsquo;t an exception. First effort to produce XML version of iCal standards was xCal. The xCal was plain vanilla XML tags conversion of iCal, i.e. it just used simple tags without namespaces. Later it was decided that it should rather be RDF instead the plain vanilla XML. The RDF essentially allows you to describe various properties of an entity and its relationship with other entities; much the same way you describe the entities using columns in data tables and use primary and foreign keys to relate other data tables. So the RDF killed plain vanilla xCal work prematurely and a W3C group started working on the one-to-one conversion of iCal to RDF, now referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2003/11/rdfical/www2004-draft-20031113-final-1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RDFiCal&lt;/a&gt; . So who is using RDFiCal? Apparently few programs like Mozilla Calendar supports this format and there are program libraries available to work with it too but there is very little content available to consume. For example, iCalShare, the largest public calendar website, doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about publishing in RDFiCal format. While RDFiCal is still striving to get acceptance, a working group sponsored by International Press Telecommunications Council has announced that they have started working on something called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iptc.org/EventsML/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EventML&lt;/a&gt; to describe events in XML format. While they are mainly aiming at events related to news and journalism industry (such as press conferences), there&amp;rsquo;s little doubt why it can&amp;rsquo;t be used for any kind of events in general. While the specs are still being worked on, it is quite possible that they pick up on popularity wave due to the support provided by major news media companies such as WSJ, AP and AFP. There is one more effort towards moving calendar info in to XML which is gaining fair attention. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/hCalendar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;hCalendar&lt;/a&gt; and is simply a one-to-one representation of iCalendar data in XHTML. This brings home one significant advantage over RDFiCal: You can easily embed event information right in to your web pages (or your blog entry) using much more simpler XHTML syntax and use CSS to transform it in human readable form. The spiders landing on your web pages can parse the hCalendar information and use it in more meaningful way. If anyone rather wants it in older iCal format, you can use online scripts such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;X2V&lt;/a&gt; for on-the-fly conversion. There are series of other XHTML based standards now collectively referred to as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.technorati.com/tag/microformat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;microformats&lt;/a&gt; . They enable you to do stuff like create an calendar entry in hCalendar format with a link to host&amp;rsquo;s contact information expressed as hCard and include reviews for that event as hReview - everything embedded in your XHTML page and rendered using CSS. Cool, right? It might appear that these microformats are trieng to compete with RDF in describing the same information in a simpler way however RDF wins hands down for it&amp;rsquo;s more richer, consistant, capable and extensible. Also the disadvantage with these microformats is that they are new and hence less popular. For example, Mozilla Calendar does not support importing or exporting as hCal yet. And however simple it might be, a very tiny percentage of people can actually write XHTML directly in their blogs or webpages unless hundreds of tools out there decides to upgrade themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-can-we-ride-on-rss&#34;&gt;So, Can We Ride On RSS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having RDFiCal is good. Now you can think about wrapping it in RSS 1.0 or 2.0. For the recap, the RSS 1.0 is the RDF based syndication format while 2.0 is plain vanilla XML. No, RSS 2.0 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a major upgrade on 1.0. They were done by different people almost in similar timeframe and unfortunately got stuck with the same name &amp;ldquo;RSS&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they were thinking but Dave Winer who updated his specs little later decided to &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/04/XMLFiles/default.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bump&lt;/a&gt; up the version number high enough so that everyone thinks that his stuff is a huge upgrade over whatever other group did. Actually RSS 2.0 indeed has extra built-in 16 tags which means it can describe the feed and items in more details out of the box. Anyway, both are pretty extensible to include whatever extra info you would care. For instance, according to RSS 2.0 spec you simply need to put new elements in your own namespace to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#extendingRss&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;extend RSS&lt;/a&gt; . It&amp;rsquo;s so easy that it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as surprise that the spec for RSS 2.0 event extension is already out there. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.esfstandard.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Event Share Specification&lt;/a&gt;, or ESS in short (which coincidently rhymes with RSS). The idea was that the websites would start putting up blue &lt;a href=&#34;http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/archive/2004/10/23/13114.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;icons for ESS&lt;/a&gt; instead of orange RSS icon which people could use to subscribe to event feeds but this never quite got picked up. For RSS 1.0 extensions comes more &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; and can inter-relate. For example, you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://planb.nicecupoftea.org/archives/000074.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;embed&lt;/a&gt; RDFiCal along with FOAF (Friend of A friend) and geo info in RSS 1.0 feed and do the RDF queries like: show me what my friends are up to this weekend in 20 miles of radius of my home. It turns out that RSS 1.0 also have an official extension module called &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RDF-Events&lt;/a&gt;. But unfortunately it was really basic and many people found that their needs aren&amp;rsquo;t being met. Both ESS as well as RDF-Events didn&amp;rsquo;t received much acceptance anywhere but we would see the reasons in a little while. One more way to include calendaring information in RSS feed is to use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;enclosure&lt;/a&gt; which essentially allows you to attach a file along with your blog entry. This is the scheme used by sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rsscalendar.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RSS Calendar&lt;/a&gt;. Just like podcasting where you include link to mp3 files in RSS item, you can include links to iCal files with MIME type text/calendar. To fully use of this scheme, however, an upgrade is required for the RSS readers so they can process these enclosures. Technically speaking, RSS in this scheme is essentially redundant because calendar programs can anyway keep polling webserver for updates to the iCal files; they don&amp;rsquo;t need RSS feed for that. The RSS feed only serves purpose to entice people who are exclusively Windows and Outlook users, aren&amp;rsquo;t familier with iCal but can relate the RSS with the concept of subscribing. As they are the majority crowd, it might make a commercial sense to ride on the RSS popularity and use this buzz word technology that they are already familier with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rss-data-flop-show&#34;&gt;The RSS-Data Flop Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another notable thing that happened along the way. Jeremy Allaire &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/2003/10/01.html#a236&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tried to extend&lt;/a&gt; this whole concept. The thinking was: why we are focusing on just Calendar information? There is all kind of dynamic info being published on the web everyday such as weather data, stock data, traffic data and so on. Why not define the common standard so we can syndicate these data, not just the blobs of text, over RSS. He came up with the term RSS-Data and thought about including real objects in the RSS feed which were serialized using XML-RPC protocol. It would be nice to have a generic &amp;ldquo;Object Aggregator&amp;rdquo; which can collect objects from all over the web and present them in a way that&amp;rsquo;s appropriate for those objects. For example, displaying objects representing stock prices on a continuous graph, weather in system tray balloon, events in Calendar view and news items in regular HTML view and so on. But most people didn&amp;rsquo;t liked this idea and there was lots of criticism all over the web. These people believed that if you want to put extra info in RSS feed, just define a new namespace for that data and extend the RSS as the original spec suggests. Putting those XML-RPC objects in RSS destroys its simplicity. Eventually RSS-Data thing never really took off although every now and then some guy would re-invent it and bring it up once in a while. If you think about it, Allaire essentially re-invented a form of Web Services with the difference that the idea was far less capable and didn&amp;rsquo;t had vast amount of infrastructure support that is already available for web services. Why would I publish my weather data objects in RSS feed when I can expose them through popular web service standards? As you might guess, any RSS-Data talk is destined to die out because of enormous popularity of web services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-s-the-solution&#34;&gt;So What&amp;rsquo;s The Solution?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do we stand now? How do I publish my event info so people can aggregate them in their calendars? In my opinion any type of RSS extension is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the way to go. Almost every other website owned by some group or organization currently publishes some kind of event listing but the thing is that the vast majority of these websites are poor man&amp;rsquo;s websites; most of them don&amp;rsquo;t even have regular RSS. Trieng to Implement event subscription using RSS extensions means convincing lot of people to write lot of code. It&amp;rsquo;s two sided sword: Publishers need to upgrade their code and/or webserver technology &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; consumers need to upgrade their RSS aggregators. This is expensive affair and taxes both the publishers as well as consumers. As you can see, all these makes the chicken-and-egg problem worse than it is already. If you dump RSS extensions, you are left with the alternative of using iCalendar files directly just as the Apple&amp;rsquo;s iCal app do. In my opinion, this is the strongest contender for the price because a huge content of over 200,000 event calendars is already available in this format. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait until the people gets interested and start creating the content. The community is already out there. Also this option is least expensive for both publishers and consumers. Any website owner can easily create iCalendar files using free programs such as Mozilla Calendar. All they have to do is to just FTP them on their webserver. On the client side, the consumers can use the same free programs to import event calendars and keep polling websites at regular intervals for updates. Works flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;then-why-are-we-stuck&#34;&gt;Then Why Are We Stuck?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few programs available that can lets you at least import (if not truly subscribe) either iCal or RDF formats. These programs also lets you add an event details with their user interface and export it as iCal. The bad news is none of these programs (at least no freeware) available on Windows really &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo;. Many are also not optimized to function as calendar aggregator. Sure there are web-based apps such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://interfacethis.com/iwebcal/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iWebCal&lt;/a&gt; but I believe, as long as calendaring apps are concerned, I really need a desktop app. Only desktop app would lets me do such things as setup reminders and carry my entire schedule with me offline. Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly look at four major programs available on Windows: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mozilla Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rockinsoftware.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Win Dates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eventsherpa.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Events&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/products/works/default.mspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microsoft Works&lt;/a&gt;. Now Mozilla Calendar truly sucks. Besides awful looks, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have working subscription or publishing capabilities. For instance it neither provides a way to manage subscriptions nor does it lets you select multiple events and export them. Next Win Dates does a good job but it&amp;rsquo;s commercial. In my opinion, convincing companies, organizations and non-profit groups to buy a software is more painful then copying event info manually in my calendar. EventSherpa had a good start and received lot of praises but suddenly the whole thing has disappeared. And finally, MS Works is just too much bloated to be used as calendar aggregator and of course it&amp;rsquo;s a commercial product. Because of all these, 90% of users (ahh, Windows users), neither have awareness nor capability to easily share, publish and subscribe to calendar data. This is also the major reason why it has only became moderately popular among websites to put the event listings as iCal or RDF calendar feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at various major standards that enables exchanging calendar information. We also reviewed how iCal is already being popularly used to publish and subscribe event information. We concluded that the efforts towards extending RSS for publishing event information is prohibitively expensive for publishers as well as consumers. We finally reasoned that the calendar subscription technologies really haven&amp;rsquo;t become popular primarily because of lack of awareness among Windows users which in turn could be attributed to the astonishing absence of quality free calendaring software that runs on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trading Geek Dinner For Self-Theories Of Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/trading-geek-dinner-for-self-theories-of-intelligence/</link>

      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/trading-geek-dinner-for-self-theories-of-intelligence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d to ditch the grand &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.micropersuasion.com/2005/04/scoble_rubel_ho.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New York geek dinner&lt;/a&gt; to attend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nyas.org/events/eventDetail.asp?eventID=3182&amp;amp;date=5/2/2005%207:15:00%20PM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a talk&lt;/a&gt; on how the Brain makes memories at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nyas.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New York Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. This is my current absolute favorite subject to spend all my free time so I HAD to be there. The talk also turned out to be very energetic, fun and fast paced by Jennifer Mangels of Columbia University. The first part of the talk was about the role of the hippocampus in forming long term memories and her research. What they tried to do was to record EEG signals from different areas of the neocortex when a person tries to memorize something and recall it back later. Her research attempts to &lt;em&gt;imperially&lt;/em&gt; prove that different areas of the brain must strongly participate together to have hippocampus realize the importance of the incoming information and form the contextual long term memories. While I really disgust at how everyone in neuroscience these days just do some EEGs and fMRIs and run around to write conclusions, above theory fits well with Jeff Hawkin&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/jeff-hawkins-on-intelligence/&#34;&gt;On Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However more interesting was the second part of the talk: The Self Theory of Intelligence. This is very interesting. In 1970s, Carol Dweck did some research on human motivation in school children and noted that some students intrinsically tend to persist in the face of failure while others quit as soon as the going gets rough. After more investigations, she discovered that student&amp;rsquo;s beliefs about the nature of intelligence had a strong connection with the way they approach challenging intellectual tasks: Students who view their intelligence as an unchangeable internal characteristic tend to shy away from academic challenges, whereas students who believe that their intelligence can be increased through effort and persistence seek them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students who hold an &amp;ldquo;entity&amp;rdquo; theory of intelligence agree with statements such as &amp;ldquo;Your intelligence is something about you that you can&amp;rsquo;t change very much.&amp;rdquo; Since they believe their intelligence is fixed, these students place high value on success. They worry that failure-or even having to work very hard at something-will be perceived as evidence of their low intelligence. Therefore, they make academic choices that maximize the possibility that they will perform well. For example, a student may opt to take a lower-level course because it will be easier to earn an A. In contrast, students who have an &amp;ldquo;incremental&amp;rdquo; theory of intelligence are not threatened by failure. Because they believe that their intelligence can be increased through effort and persistence, these students set mastery goals and seek academic challenges that they believe will help them to grow intellectually (Dweck, 1999b).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dweck&amp;rsquo;s research on the impact of praise suggests that many teachers and parents may be unwittingly leading students to accept an entity view of intelligence. By praising students for their intelligence, rather than effort, many adults are sending the message that success and failure depend on something beyond the students&amp;rsquo; control. Comments such as &amp;ldquo;You got a great score on your math test, Jimmy! You are such a smart boy!&amp;rdquo; are interpreted by students as &amp;ldquo;If success means that I am smart, then failure must mean that I am dumb.&amp;rdquo; When these students perform well they have high self-esteem, but this crashes as soon as they hit an academic stumbling block. Students who are praised for their effort are much more likely to view intelligence as being malleable, and their self-esteem remains stable regardless of how hard they may have to work to succeed at a task. (More at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eintell/dweck.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;her page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr.Mangels then showed some videos demonstrating how EEG patterns differ in these two types of people. This is very significant. It essentially implies that you can device a helmet for a person to wear and after few EEG recordings I would be able to tell if person is in one group or another! Think, interviews would be so different ;).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Go Left Handed For Mouse</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/go-left-handed-for-mouse/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2005 21:10:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/go-left-handed-for-mouse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I observed how unequally I use my right and left hands. It’s not because I don’t type with my both hands but it’s because I use only the right hand in maneuvering and clicking the mouse. Considering the number of clicks I make per day, this huge lack of load-balancing is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifehacker.com/software/life-hacks/how-to-avoid-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-101679.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;terrible&lt;/a&gt;! So I switched the mouse on left hand and it’s been great (reminds me the first time I hold the mouse) except that my mouse is curved so it’s comfortable only on right hand. I guess I’m gonna get a new mouse which is left+right handed, wireless (easy to switch hands), optical and at least 5 buttons. Don’t forget to reverse the mouse buttons in control panel! This is really fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, besides those &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ergonomics.com.au/howtosit.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sitting posture tips&lt;/a&gt;, I think the one factor that strongly affects your creativity at work is how far you can look from your desk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>StarWars Weekend Marathon</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/starwars-weekend-marathon-2005/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2005 13:49:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/starwars-weekend-marathon-2005/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We planned back-to-back original StarWars trilogy marathon over the weekend. I got to watch them in sequence for the first time and it made lot of sense and gave me a new perspective about this whole “religion”. Some observations…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First StarWars wasn’t really advertised as Episode IV. That tag came later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After watching first StarWars anyone could see that Princes Liea and Luke were going to be a couple. All indications are that, Lucas changed his intentions for V and VI for God knows why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the story point of view, IV remains the coolest. The V is a head twisting story and VI looks like a patch work to justify what V did. This is, of course, not to mean that these movies aren’t still some of the coolest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucas didn’t asked for more compensation for making first StarWars but instead rights to make sequel. He took the loan from the bank and made the sequels from his &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; money. This is strikingly unusual and highlight of the confidence on what he believed in (especially when sequels are such a huge gamble that no one in the industry invests their own money to make them). Before I watched the marathon, my impression for Lucas was a person who knew how to maximize cash from popularity. While this hasn’t changed much, I’ve gained new appreciation for him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;m your father” was a last minute story edit. Even the director who was hired by Lucas to make V wasn’t aware of it. It seems that Lucas who had been buried under big lone from the bank, severe over budgeting and schedule slippage decided to use typical tactics of putting a huge “surprise” that would make people wanna come for the sequel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest asset of StarWars is probably the background musical score. Initial edits of first StarWars without this musical score looks like a B grade sci-fi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times has published a long &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050509/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;article about StarWars&lt;/a&gt; apparently with tons of praise for Lucas and without a single critic for Episode I and II which universally believed to be “sucked”. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;You can tell&lt;/a&gt; Lucas has hired some really deep reach PR firm :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gold pack is the re-released (digitally retouched) version of the movies which means it looks really cool and young. My wife pointed out that at the end of the Episode VI when Luke sees his father along with Yoda and Obi-Van, the original actor has been digitally replaced with the one who appears in I &amp;amp; II! Obviously, Lucas hadn’t planned it all along 🙂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Mazda RX-8 Review</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/mazda-rx-8-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2005 21:19:52 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/mazda-rx-8-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;rsquo;s the time to write down bits about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mazdausa.com/MusaWeb/handleHomeFlash.action?vehicleCode=RX8&amp;amp;modelYear=2005&amp;amp;bhcp=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mazda RX-8&lt;/a&gt; for the benefit of future buyers. This is the car we bought in year 2004. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the 2005 model is exactly the same but I haven&amp;rsquo;t checked it. Anyway lets start the engines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This car is a real head turner. I mean REAL. People see BMWs and Mercedes SLK350 and go ahh. This car is beyond that. Here, people not just go ahh but they literally stop you, tell you that they just went ahh and ask details about the car. And by &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; I mean complete strangers of all age and all types (even those truck and SUVs fans). It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for us to get one such stranger encounter every other week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RX-8 has got automatic plus semi manual shifting called &amp;ldquo;sport&amp;rdquo; mode. In sport mode, you can shift gears right on the steering wheel! Also this mode is safe even if you tend to screw up when driving manual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a rear wheel drive and that means it really sucks on the snow. Actually it sucks more than average rear wheel drives. The semi-manual shifting doesn&amp;rsquo;t help in snow because it looks like the automatic vehicle stability controls is turned off when you switch to manual so it&amp;rsquo;s even more dangerous to manual on snow. When it was snowing heavily for couple of days, I preferred to park my car in parking lot and take the train.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s little more above then ground (with those big tires, of course) then most sports car. This helps a lot when you on dirty-rocky road. However you may not cross lanes by going over divider lines like those SUVs do. On the plus side, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t flip over like those SUVs do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This car has rotary engines, not cylinders. So terms like V4, V6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to it. It simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any pistons. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to explain this to people when their first question for sports cars is &amp;ldquo;oh, is that V8?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coolest feature that might get peoples jaw dropped for this car is suicide doors. They are extremely cool. We have seen car passing us by and then backing up to us asking &amp;ldquo;what is that?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s even more fun when you try to get insurance for this car. &amp;ldquo;How many doors it has?&amp;rdquo; the agent might ask. It&amp;rsquo;s technically neither 2 door or 4 door! This car defies the common mold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many reviews I&amp;rsquo;d read said the trunk space is small. So far we didn&amp;rsquo;t had problems putting our stuff including telescope, guest luggage, caving gear and what not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you frequently go outdoor places, GPS is not optional. In early 2004 model, the factory installed GPS had really bad software so we didn&amp;rsquo;t took it and bought after market Garmin. However Mazda has upgraded this software in December, 2004 and it&amp;rsquo;s as good as any after market GPS. I believe GPS is probably the most important thing in the car after steering wheel, gas and breaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RX-8 has cool design for in-between seat space. You get two cup holders in front and back, 3 big storage compartments, and two cigarette lighters. Totally worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want the red one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seat design and covers has star trekee looks. The covers are made from washable and really wear resistant special material. This means you can put heavy stuff like big luggage bags with pointy corners on the seats without worry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This car is a huge gas guzzler. I guess it consumes at least 30% more gas then typical 4 door cars of similar size. We need to refill typically after every 5 hours of drive. And just so you know, this car only likes to have 93 octane premium gas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On another luxury preferences of this car, you can only tow it on a flat bed. Other towing may damage the car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RX-8 has powerful big breaks. Infect its breaks have same specs as Porsche Carrera GT. You might also notice that tires do not have wheel covers allowing faster cooling of those big breaks. The bad part is that lots of rust gets in to those parts and sometime it looks awful. However Mazda engineers have let us know that this is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R8-8 dimensions are very similar to Porsche Carrera GT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no rear wipers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So far I&amp;rsquo;ve took it to 110 mph (higher speed isn&amp;rsquo;t easy in tri-state area). High speed is pretty natural to this car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RX-8 has rotary engines and it makes unique pleasant sound then engine with cylinders. The main advantage seems to be their super compact size and disadvantage being they are gas guzzlers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently only Mazda makes cars with rotary engines. They had released RX-7 about 8 years ago and the RX-8 is new incarnation with more compact and efficient engines. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rx8club.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RX-8 club&lt;/a&gt; which has tons of rotary engine fans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has almost enough head rooms for 6 ft people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has dumb headlights - totally manual, no photo sensors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have dumb doors (the ones you need to slam hard couple of times to get them shut).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This car requires mirrors to be perfectly set to avoid blind spots. It&amp;rsquo;s more important than other cars. That means, if you are a couple, you both should be of nearly equal height people so if you switch seats, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to reset the whole thing again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike typical 2-door sports cars, this car is excellent for new couples planning to start family in near future because you get the extra seats behind with own their little doors :). This car perfectly fits the title of &amp;ldquo;family sports car&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other goodies included are digital speedometer and outside temperature. There is no compass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the biggest thing I dislike in this car is non-standard stereo. The factory installed one is pretty low end and you can&amp;rsquo;t replace it with after market ones because it&amp;rsquo;s non standard! That&amp;rsquo;s huge deal. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame for Mazda because cars with half the price now comes with MP3 CD player and FM with text. The 9-speaker BOSS system is less them impressive when it comes to sound quality and to me it looks like waste of money. Actually 9 speakers are pretty much useless anyway because Mazda system can&amp;rsquo;t play audio disks with DVD-A encoding which are specifically designed for surround sound experience. Mazda does sell proprietary MP3 replacement player, however, for $350 only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like most other cars, you would be required to heavily negotiate with dealers for pricing. In 2004, I kept hearing price tag of $29,000 (without tax) when I started looking and finally bought the car for $24,500 inclusive everything. The Wayne Mazda is an excellent dealer and service shop if you are in NJ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because RX-8 is pretty new, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell anything about engine life and resell values. But I believe both are pretty good if you look at RX-7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the problem with this car is that after you start the engine and then if you need to shut it down without driving, you have to step on gas while still in park mode and &amp;ldquo;rave up&amp;rdquo; the engines and then shut it down. Not doing this step causes something called flooding reported by many people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RX-8 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have 5 star &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/testing/ncap/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;safety ratings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get pretty powerful xenon headlights, sun-glass holder, automatic tire pressure indicator and no-traction indicator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Places I Found On Google Maps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Google Maps included a link for satellite views, I ended up spending a night in finding all kind of places. Yeah, this is &lt;a href=&#34;http://terraserver.microsoft.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;not new&lt;/a&gt; but not it is so much more cleaner, convenient and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updates - Spring 2005</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/updates-spring-2005/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2005 18:44:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/updates-spring-2005/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would be writing all New York City related stuff at &lt;a href=&#34;http://nyc.metblogs.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Metblogs&lt;/a&gt; rather then my own blog. This makes sense because lot of people who aren&amp;rsquo;t in this region doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to get those NYC stories. On the other hand, my NYC related writing will now reach to much larger audience. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=site:nyc.metblogs.com+%22shital+shah%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;c2coff=1&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;filter=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some of my entries there&lt;/a&gt; about cool New York events, restaurants and such stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other site news, you might have noticed new skin and more FireFox friendly design. I also decided to give away the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/SyFastPage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;engine that my website runs on&lt;/a&gt; (C# code I wrote almost 4 years ago) along with entire &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/ShitalShahWebV3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source code for this website&lt;/a&gt; (thats in VB.Net just for fun). Nothing special but main highlights of the engine is that it accepts raw HTML file as the base template and embeds your dynamic ASP.Net WebForm content inside that HTML. It also provides navigation control which runs off of XHTML templates and XML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like my free utilities, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/category/software/&#34;&gt;massive updates in my Software section&lt;/a&gt;. It has now many more of my programs and utilities that I kept it to myself. Specifically, the one called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/BrowserHistoryAnalyzer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Browser History Analyzer&lt;/a&gt; analyses your IE history (support for FireFox coming soon), builds MS Access database and gives you tons of amusing info about your browsing habits such has the queries you fired on search engine, how do you refine your keywords progressively, how much time you usually spend on a page, how much time you spend on browsing and so on. Whilte still in development, it also features extensible architecture to let you make your own plugins. I&amp;rsquo;ve also put the link for article I wrote for CodeProject about &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/WinProgressDialog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how to show Explorer&amp;rsquo;s progress dialog in your apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally some &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/photos/111712720654017421562/albums/5987178406068558081&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alaska trip photos&lt;/a&gt; also have been added. Yenjoy :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buying And Selling Broadway Show Tickets</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/buying-and-selling-broadway-show-tickets-2005/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2005 16:34:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/buying-and-selling-broadway-show-tickets-2005/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to buy Broadway show tickets these days, scene is really the worse. Few years ago, you only had to deal with idiotic Ticketmaster and now the pain is extended to &lt;a href=&#34;http://tech2.nytimes.com/mem/technology/techreview.html?res=9803E3DB133CF934A25750C0A9639C8B63&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;100s of brokers&lt;/a&gt; that have mushroomed to somehow &amp;ldquo;lawfully&amp;rdquo; buying off all the nicest seats and later sells it with the price tag of 2X or more. No wonder shows like Wicked and Lion King are now suddenly sold out for next 8 months or so. These guys even have their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;national association&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and just makes me wonder what they did to the system so as to make their whole thing a perfectly &amp;ldquo;legal business&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entire anomaly could be blamed on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ticketmaster.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this worst ticketing website&lt;/a&gt; of the World. Not only they charge &amp;ldquo;convenience fee&amp;rdquo; of $5 per ticket for using their annoying website but unlike anything else on the Net, they have absolutely no returns policy! I think they are the good subjects to study how to force customer to knowingly pay more then they should, how to have no returns policy, worst possible customer service and still maintain almost a monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you get in to buying/selling Broadway show tickets, here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are buying at last minute, try &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eBay.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;. However if you are after those popular shows, don’t rely on &amp;ldquo;manual&amp;rdquo; bidding. It doesn’t work. You may quickly realize that most bids on such auctions occur in the last 60 seconds of auction (known as &amp;ldquo;bidding war&amp;rdquo;). The bid prices literally go twice for these tickets during the last few seconds. This is courtesy of the automated programs (robots) called snipers which bids on your behalf in last few seconds before the auction closes. The one web-based sniper that I used and which reliably worked was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eSnipe.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eSnipe&lt;/a&gt;. But there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;q=auction+sniper&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tons of others&lt;/a&gt; out there. Other place to look out is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.craigslist.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Craig’s list&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stubhub.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;stub hub&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you wanted to sell your tickets at the last moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, let’s all continue to hate and investigate how Ticketmaster manages to stay alive (and use that knowledge to kill it one day).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electrons Are Out, Photons Are In</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/electrons-are-out-photons-are-in/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2005 02:42:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/electrons-are-out-photons-are-in/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our custom made PC based &amp;ldquo;media center&amp;rdquo; just got its new replacement screen: &lt;a href=&#34;http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?sku=2300CC1&amp;amp;c=us&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;cs=19&amp;amp;category_id=2999&amp;amp;page=external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dell 2300MP Projector&lt;/a&gt;! Short review: It rocks and totally worth it (especially playing PS2 games wired with 5.1 sound system and WinAmp Visualizers on a big screen). And here are more tidbits for you geeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dell 2300MP is new line of DLP projector which (I guess) came out in Oct 2004. It has whooping 2300 lumens and 2100 contrast ratio and cost me $1165 including shipping. It&amp;rsquo;s native resolution is 1024X768 which exceeds many plasmas. Projector of this class used to cost almost twice a year ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PS2 even with S-Video connector gives pretty cool quality. Through 5.1 surround sound system with games like Grand Theft Auto and you can hear cars passing by around you as if you are on real road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This projector doesn&amp;rsquo;t have DVI connector (for digital video from PCs) and component video/RGB connection (for high resolution DVD movies or 1080i HDTV format). That means you can only go as good as S-Vide. Also it has only one S-Video port. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is a huge disadvantage because more resolution offered by these connectors can&amp;rsquo;t be displayed by projector anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It comes with lots of wires (though short in length) and a slick case. Remember projector wiring and screen is a significant portion of total projector cost. A 25ft VGA cable alone can cost easily over $50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One big limitation of most projection system is that you can project only a specific size picture from specific distance. So say if you have have 85&amp;rdquo; diagonal area available project on be able place projector at around 10-12 ft from the wall. No more no less. And yes, you must buy enough long wires to hook up all your PS2s, cable TVs and PCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This projector is super bright and it looks terrific even on our direct white wall projection without using any screen at all. It’s so bright that we don’t even feel needed to turn off our lights. On the daytime, if you have really bright room (no curtains on big glass wall), picture would appear washed out – not good enough for DVD quality but still pretty good for talk shows like quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of high lumens and contrast, the most suitable screens for this projector are matt white screens with the gain 1.0 or even lower. This eliminated need for high gain screens means you get wide viewing angle just like usual TV set and uncompromising colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people complained about circular &amp;ldquo;rainbows&amp;rdquo; that appears when watching B&amp;amp;W movies. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to appear so far with us but I guess it might popup if you are watching high contrast black and white movie for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of high contrast, darker scenes in the movie would feel darker. You will need to mess around with settings for this for a while (Dogma=3 works for us pretty well). BTW, we run at only 40% of its maximum brightness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When projector is not placed right at the center of screen but on lower or upper side. You get a distortion called keystone. This projector has built-in key-stone elimination feature which works great but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any way to shrink picture horizontally or vertically or compensate for horizontal center-off alignment. If you are planning to project on for more than 100&amp;rdquo;, you should consider exact center ceiling mount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you still don’t think projector is a best bet for a screen, do a math on movie tickets. And even then if you don’t get convinced, go watch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308508/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Step into liquid&lt;/a&gt; on 85&amp;rdquo; screen projected by this little toy! It&amp;rsquo;s brilliant!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Using Windows Explorer Progress Dialog In Your Application</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/using-windows-explorer-progress-dialog-in-your-application/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2004 19:37:27 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ProgressDialogDemo&#34; width=&#34;381&#34; height=&#34;169&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-897&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo.jpg 381w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/ProgressDialogDemo-300x133.jpg 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you copy lot of files in Explorer, you see the standard Windows progress dialog with &amp;ldquo;flying papers&amp;rdquo; animation and the calculation of estimated time remaining. This dialog is accessible to any Windows application through &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/iprogressdialog/iprogressdialog.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IProgressDialog interface&lt;/a&gt;. This source code provides you a managed .Net wrapper to easily and intuitively integrate Windows Progress Dialog in your own applications. You can read more details in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9298/Using-Windows-Explorer-Progress-Dialog-In-Your-App&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my original article on CodeProject&lt;/a&gt;. Also see the comments in that article. It looks like two of the guys really hit on it and have produced a stand alone version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;obsolete&#34;&gt;
  Warning: This program was last updated on 13 Jan 2005 and is considered &lt;em&gt;obsolete&lt;/em&gt;. There are no plans to update it and no support is provided. It exists here purely for its historical and nostalgic value.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/WinProgressDialog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WinProgressDialog is now archived at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Our Alaska Trip Photos (March 2004)</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/our-alaska-trip-photos-march-2004/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2004 17:57:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/our-alaska-trip-photos-march-2004/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are our &lt;a href=&#34;https://picasaweb.google.com/111712720654017421562/AlaskaTripMarch2004?authuser=0&amp;amp;feat=directlink&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;March 2004 Alaska trip photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess&amp;nbsp;early March&amp;nbsp;is among the best time to visit Alaska (thanks to my wife for figuring out fantastic itinerary)&amp;nbsp;because you are still just in time to catch views of&amp;nbsp;Aurora Boriales and there is so much festivities going on.&amp;nbsp;We had our Yup&amp;rsquo;ik wedding ceremony at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chenahotsprings.com/icehotel.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ice Hotel at Chena Hotsprings&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is a hotel made of only ice with colorful lights shining through. Taking a dip in natural hot&amp;nbsp;sulfur rich springs in below freezing temperatures with Aurora Borealis&amp;nbsp;passing over head&amp;nbsp;could certainly bring you one of the most memorable times even if its not your wedding ceremony&amp;nbsp;night ;).&amp;nbsp;We&amp;nbsp;also attended the start of the world famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iditarod.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Iditarod Sleddog Race&lt;/a&gt; in&amp;nbsp; Anchorage,&amp;nbsp;went to&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.furrondy.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fur Rendezvous&lt;/a&gt; (a big festival in Anchorage were furs and various Alaskan crafts are bought, sold, and traded),&amp;nbsp; saw the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icealaska.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;World Ice Carving Championship&lt;/a&gt; in Fairbanks&amp;nbsp;- a definite must see to believe these finely detailed&amp;nbsp;sculpteurs carved out of ice, attended &lt;a href=&#34;http://henkbinnendijk.tripod.com/fairbanks/id16.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chatanika Days&lt;/a&gt; (a festival in Chatanika where a outhouse, snowmobile, and other races are held), and visited &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ci.whittier.ak.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Whittier&lt;/a&gt;, the strangest town in Alaska.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;nbsp;also paid a visit to capitol &amp;ldquo;city&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.juneau.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Juneau&lt;/a&gt; which is incredibly beautiful from &amp;ldquo;Lower 48&amp;rdquo; standards but not as desirable places to live from Alaskan standards :).&amp;nbsp; We also camped in 4 feet of snow overnight near&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nps.gov/dena/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Denali National Park&lt;/a&gt;, home of Denali/Mt. McKinley Mountain, the tallest mountain in North America. All that besides having lots of fun :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Jeff Richter Screwing Up The .Net Versioning?</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/is-jeff-richter-screwing-up-the-net-versioning/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2004 21:51:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/is-jeff-richter-screwing-up-the-net-versioning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how no one is bothered by this. May be because &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=AssemblyVersioning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it affects Longhorn&lt;/a&gt;. But anyway, everybody would agree that while .Net solved the DLL Hell issue, it created its own which I affectionally call Assembly Hell and had &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/21462&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my rants&lt;/a&gt; loud from the start. I&amp;rsquo;d high hopes when I heard Jeff Richter is on the team. But be hold, they come up with the statement that the problem is &amp;ldquo;mathematically&amp;rdquo; unsolvable and some fuzzy argument to back up that statement and then they reveal possibly the worst versioning scheme I&amp;rsquo;ve heard in a decade for anything: divide the assemblies in &amp;ldquo;platform&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; groups! I can&amp;rsquo;t even start to imagine someone could think of this kind of stupid idea for things that will hit the entire planet on massive scale. Must be an outcome of long meetings for days :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d been burned a lot by missing gaps in .Net versioning and problem is pretty simple if you had been in this mess. The solution is even amazingly simple for what it appears like a monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental flow in the .Net versioning is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow to put a version number on assembly without breaking the compatibility. Once you understand this, lot many problems would be simplified. The &amp;lsquo;assembly version&amp;rsquo; is what we usually use for checking whether the file is really the one what we want and for deployment modules to make an update. While &amp;lsquo;compatible-to version&amp;rsquo; is for the run time to check if it should throw an error. So &amp;lsquo;assembly version&amp;rsquo; is different then &amp;lsquo;compatible-to version&amp;rsquo; and are not tied with each other. So all we need is one AssemblyXXX attribute that can let us specify what is the build number for this assembly and another AssemblyYYY to specify the version to which this assembly is still compatible from interface as well as behaviour point of view. You always auto-increment your assembly number on each build, but you do not change &amp;ldquo;compatible-to&amp;rdquo; number unless you really change the interface and behavior. And the problem is solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infect, here is a final surprise: you can do this right now in 1.x and 2.x. Use AssemblyVersion attribute to specify &amp;ldquo;Last Compatible-To&amp;rdquo; version and AssemblyFileVersion attribute to specify the build version. Things have been worked out perfectly for me with this scheme. Now when I hear about dumbest idea since COM versioning and &amp;lsquo;plateform&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;library&amp;rsquo;, I just think we are in for huge additional mess waiting that will take another release (another 10 years?) to clean up. Whether you agree or not, people, speak up!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dev OS Choice: Windows 2003 Server Or XP</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dev-os-choice-windows-2003-server-or-xp/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2004 00:25:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dev-os-choice-windows-2003-server-or-xp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peterprovost.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Peter Provost&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/11/04/2067.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;switching to Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;. I want to say: don&amp;rsquo;t do it! I&amp;rsquo;d been using server version of operating system on my dev machines, even on laptops, since I can remember. But now I&amp;rsquo;m about to change my mind for the first time. Windows Server 2003 is not a cutting edge OS any longer. Infect it sucks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You really have to spend lot of time to set it up right to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.msfn.org/win2k3/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reclaim memory and performance&lt;/a&gt;. For example, disabling several services, disabling option for higher performance for services, enabling DirectX manually and so on - it&amp;rsquo;s always been on going job. Even than, I still find my dev box spinning way too much disk then equivalent XP box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even both OS shares lot many drivers, its sometime amazingly difficult to install some devices for Sever 2003. Infect just couple of years old hardware from Creative and ATI, the XP version of drivers just won&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many new software from Microsoft itself just don&amp;rsquo;t work on 2003. For example, Windows Media Player 10, Microsoft TimeZone etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancements from XP SP2 like IE security and Wireless config etc aren&amp;rsquo;t still available for 2003. It looks like users of 2003 are always one step behind in the line to get the new beef and its taking just too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Peer-To-Peer SDK and Advanced Networking Pack does not work on 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DVD playback and built-in CD burning is hard to get working (requires registry tricks and more).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.msfn.org/win2k3/sysrestore.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;no System Restore&lt;/a&gt;!! It might surprise you, but this is true. For this is so-called solid server OS, if file system corrupts, you lost the whole thing. This actually happened with my laptop which I just switched off while hard drives were still spinning and on next boot I was greeted with blue screen with a message that registry was corrupted. This could have been a legitimate power loss also. It was after-midnight and I really needed few things to get done. After an hour of reading docs all around Internet truth revealed: there was no way to bring 2003 back to life because there is no System Restore feature in this OS!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it just appears that Microsoft simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t care if the new software/drivers they released on XP doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on 2003. They just don&amp;rsquo;t care. I really hate this line between server and home OS versions. Everybody knows that this lines have been drawn just to milk more money from fat corporates for so-called server versions. Few might know, XP and 2003 shares almost identical kernels (even OS version numbers are 5.01 and 5.02 respectively). Right now, you choose any flavor of OS, you not gonna get satisfied because something is missing. Its not because of technicality but pure politics of pricing. And thats a shame to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coolest New York Shows In Run</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/coolest-new-york-shows-in-run/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2004 22:10:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/coolest-new-york-shows-in-run/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are the some of the select broadway/off-broadway shows currently running in New York. Many of them ends soon. If you live in area, do check them out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatermania.com/content/show.cfm/show/106244&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GoogleWhack&lt;/a&gt; - This small production comedy had been consistently sold out in UK and Australia. Even if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been, its pretty geeky enough for not to check it out :). We will be going to this show tonight! Ends December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatermania.com/content/show.cfm/show/104809&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Forever Tango&lt;/a&gt; - Looks extremely cool. Seven couple who tango in their own styles from Argentine. Ends Nov 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatermania.com/content/show.cfm/show/101919&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cookin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; - A terrific show. Korean crew creates awesome beats and music from mere kitchen appliances besides other jaw dropping stuff in the show. Absolutely recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatermania.com/content/show.cfm/show/132&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Blue Man Show&lt;/a&gt; - If you want to see just one off-Broadway show in New York, this would be it. We went to this one last December and its an awesomely creative show which you might enjoy every moment of it (and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have intermission). Its difficult to describe what this show is about but one can escape describing it by calling higher form of modern art, just like its music. The show that&amp;rsquo;s being currently running has new &amp;ldquo;material&amp;rdquo; though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slavasnowshow.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Slava&amp;rsquo;s Snow Show&lt;/a&gt; - While except for closing sequence it wasn&amp;rsquo;t ultra cool, it sure was different. One might think its kids show but when we went to see it, we hardly observed more than couple of kids in audience (and show was sold out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trans-siberian.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trans-Siberian Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; - This is the most impressive, most awesome and the coolest live concert I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been too. To miss them in live concert would be practically a sin. With hundreds of colorful spotlights, and another few hundreds of freaking lasers, and some cool fireworks right on the stage and a band of more than 20 musicians and singers and with very diversified styles, they simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nycomedyfestival.com/new/lineup/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Steven Wright Comedy Show&lt;/a&gt; - For a long time I considered Steve Wright as the most gifted comedian I&amp;rsquo;d known. His ability to make up original random unrelated witty one-liners which he can keep throwing at you one after another for the entire length of show is amazing. He hasn&amp;rsquo;t doing many shows since last few years but finally New York Comedy Festival provides a chance to hear him live!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as a side tip, many (but not all) broadway show tickets you can buy at heavily discounted prices by entering secret codes. Sources to check out for this are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatermania.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TheaterMania.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.broadwaybox.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BroadwayBox.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://entertainment-link.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;entertainment-link.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://faculty.rmwc.edu/theatre/Ticket%20Watch/Current.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NY Times TicketWatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A New NewsGator Online Convert</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/a-new-newsgator-online-convert/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2004 21:12:15 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/a-new-newsgator-online-convert/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any software that isn&amp;rsquo;t open source AND also isn&amp;rsquo;t evolving fast enough to keep up with their customers should be seen with the sign &amp;ldquo;Stay Away&amp;rdquo;. These things gets in to your computer in the name of easing up your tasks and it indeed appears so for a while until you just run of out its capacity and start spending most of the time in just managing it or dealing with information overload. &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/continual-survival-of-sharpreader/&#34;&gt;Sharpreader&lt;/a&gt; is the one. Windows is another. While my desktop will soon have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mandrakelinux.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linux Mandrake&lt;/a&gt; distribution, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it will still solve the problem because Linux is open source but it ain&amp;rsquo;t fast enough to evolve, in my view. But finally I was able to take care of SharpReader. Check out the free and cool &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsgator.com/ngs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NewsGator Online Edition&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m a convert since last two weeks and I like its not-large-but-effective featureset which includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows to rate posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows to clip posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows to share your clips using RSS (which you can eventually save on your hard drive for archival purpose).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows to share your OPML in real time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need of syncing news readers on different boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty cool non-interuptive Web UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features #1 and #2 are essential in dealing with information overload. I&amp;rsquo;ve also categorized &lt;a href=&#34;http://services.newsgator.com/ngws/svc/opml.aspx?uid=2080&amp;amp;mid=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my feeds&lt;/a&gt; in to just 3 categories: Peoples blogs, High interest services, Low interest services. Things have gotten pretty smooth after establishing these categories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Cheatsheet And Clusty</title>

      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/google-cheatsheet-and-clusty/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I know everything there is to know about Google searching, until&amp;hellip; I found there is an operator to search for synonyms and two words separated by a word and so on. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/help/cheatsheet.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Cheetsheet&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that I&amp;rsquo;m often switching to &lt;a href=&#34;http://clusty.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clusty&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;ldquo;hard to find&amp;rdquo; things - usually when Googles first page of results is just irrelevant. I think clustering is inevitable technology for search engines and really hope Google speeds up their effort for implementation. It isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Genres To Explore</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/music-genres-to-explore-nov-2004/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2004 22:41:27 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/music-genres-to-explore-nov-2004/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like me and constantly run out of fresh new music to listen, here&amp;rsquo;s something that might help. The best way to discover new music is to find new/fresh/weird genres. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to put here a list of very interesting select genres that I came across recently. I would highly recommend services like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.listen.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt; if you want to explore these. What’s more important is the way they provide navigation and ability to discover more. For example, once you find an interesting album, you can immediately click on the music genre that album belongs to and then find out the top chart for that genre and discover even more artists and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are some cool and weird music genres to explore 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laptronica - This is basically music created by single person entirely by high-end software on his or her laptop. Some of popular laprtronica artists even have their concerts where they just sit on the stage with their laptop and stream out some beats for the audience! Example artist M83.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimental - This is the awesome genre to explore and can keep you busy for hours. Try Blue Man Group&amp;rsquo;s Audio album or a &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/song/default.asp?songID=3363203&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;super-weird track by Tom Waits&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;rsquo;ll know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solo Instrumentalist - Example artist Itzhak Perlman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Age/Solo Instrumental - Example artist David Lanz. These for some &amp;ldquo;non-intruding softer displays of creativity&amp;rdquo; times :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Age Acoustics - Example artist George Winston. These are for some happy relaxing &amp;ldquo;find your soul&amp;rdquo; times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space Age Bachelor Pad - Yes, that’s really a name of a music genre! Example artist Pizzicato Five.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut &amp;amp; Paste - Too abstract to be classed as hip-hop, kind of beat-based experiments. Example artist Cold cut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electroclash - Energetic synth, electro-techno-pop-punk hybrid. Example artist Fischerspooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bleep - Moody robotic sounds, too irregular for the dancefloor yet often too disruptive for passive listening. Pretty cool worktime music. Example artist Autechre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dream Pop - So how about an album named &amp;ldquo;Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements&amp;rdquo; by Streolab?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these, there is a lot to explore in Foreign, Comedy and Theater genres too. But that some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DVD-Audio Format</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dvd-audio-format/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2004 21:32:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dvd-audio-format/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/blue-man-group-and-polyphonic-spree/&#34;&gt;recent quest&lt;/a&gt; to find new music, I bumped in to brand new &lt;a href=&#34;http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid5_gci510035,00.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DVD-A format&lt;/a&gt; on which many &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/574074/102-8083421-0521740&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new demanding music albums&lt;/a&gt; are being delivered. It appears that this is definitely the next generation of music quality but there is very little or no information on many of its aspects. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize what I found so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This format is capable of delivering very high quality multi-channel surround sound on your home theater system. The DVD-A format is entirely different than usual &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/adbarr/page1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dolby Digital or DTS&lt;/a&gt; which is used for DVD movies. The quality that could be delivered using DVD-A is superior than Dolby Digital or DTS. If you look in to your DVD disk in Windows Explorer, you will find that there are two folders: Audio_TS and Video_TS. So far, only Video_TS folder was used to put all the movie files on DVDs because industry wasn&amp;rsquo;t settled on standards for DVD-A format. Recently standards have been finalized and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/574074&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;loads of new music albums&lt;/a&gt; are now being released in this format. They have content inside Audio_TS folder which contains DVD-A audio tracks in files with extension .aob. Because its brand new format, you need &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalaudioguide.com/dareview/players.htm#da%20(DVD-Audio)%20Players&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;newer DVD players&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.soundblaster.com/products/Audigy2ZS_platinum_pro/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sound cards&lt;/a&gt; to play it. However because most people aren&amp;rsquo;t going to upgrade their DVD players soon, these audio DVDs supply same sound tracks in Video_TS folder encoded in usual Dolby Digital or DTS which all players knows how to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now say you buy an audio album on DVD disc. Obviously you can&amp;rsquo;t play it on car stereo or your portable MP3 players because it’s a DVD disc rather than normal audio CD. Or you might want to take backup of your DVD-A disc as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/domorewith/sursoshowcase.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WMA Pro&lt;/a&gt; files on your PC whcih allows 7.1 surround sound and playback. So what you do? You need to convert DVD disc in to normal Audio disc or rip tracks to MP3s. Unfortunately this isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. The DVD-A format employs &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1638228,00.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;higher level of encryption&lt;/a&gt; than usual DVDs. The DVD videos (stored in .vob files) employs copy protection scheme called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1638226,00.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; which can be broken in to very easily using DeCSS or even more friendly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dvddecrypter.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DVD Decryptor&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digitalaudioguide.com/faq/dvd-audio/faq_intro.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DVD-A format&lt;/a&gt; which was developed later has learned lesson from this hack and currently there is no known way to decrypt .aob files which contains DVD-A audio tacks. That means you can&amp;rsquo;t rip MP3s out of AOB files. Your only way out is to rip off from slightly lower quality Dolby/DTS formatted tracks. The most reliable and easy to use software to do this is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castudio.org/dvdaudioextractor/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DVD Audio Extractor&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately many DVD-A albums also provides &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.videohelp.com/forum/archive/t140530.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LPCM&lt;/a&gt; version of tracks along with AC3 (i.e. Dolby Digital)/DTS format. So to burn normal audio CDs or MP3s you might want to choose LPCM version. If DVD-A disc &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000051S65/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain LPCM tracks&lt;/a&gt;, than you are out of luck. The down-mix/demux process employed by most software to convert surround sound from AC3/DTS to plain stereo format doesn&amp;rsquo;t produce same quality as commercially available stereo tracks. Though you can try &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trevormarshall.com/byte_articles/byte7.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some equations&lt;/a&gt; to combine 5.1 channels in to stereo using SoftEncode etc and usually DTS works better than AC3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blue Man Group and Polyphonic Spree</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/blue-man-group-and-polyphonic-spree/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2004 19:54:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/blue-man-group-and-polyphonic-spree/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Artists - Album]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?albumID=1013377&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Blue Man Group - Audio&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My short review of this album would be &amp;ldquo;Insanely creative&amp;rdquo;. This amazing Niagara of energy is probably very different than anything you have heard so far. Some of the tracks were composed with 15 different instruments including PVC pipes and homebrewed hybrid instruments! If you have seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blueman.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;their off-Broadway show&lt;/a&gt;, you will probably appreciate this music even more. This show is definitely one of the most creative, energetic, artistic and amusing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been too. On other note, they have second album called &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?albumID=1089095&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Complex&lt;/a&gt;. In sharp contrast, this album, apparently containing many vocals, comes nowhere close to their first. This album is available in full-blown multi-track surround DVD-A format however it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain LPCM stereo tracks, which might force you to by normal CD for MP3 extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?albumID=1090842&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Polyphonic Spree - The Beginning Stages Of Polyphonic Spree&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a highlight, &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/artist/artistFocus.asp?artistID=1099316&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this group&lt;/a&gt; is composed of 20 members including 9 dedicated just for choir, humming and making noises. They are also the only one I know of using French horn. The combined effect of this huge mix and diverse instruments is just majestic while recording quality of vocal is not as good but you probably won&amp;rsquo;t care for the kind of upbeat energy it pours in. While anyone would agree they sound amazing in live concert than on recorded media, I still believe &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/artist/default.asp?artistID=1027398&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trans-Siberian Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; has still maintained its &amp;ldquo;absolute best&amp;rdquo; position with me as far as large bands are concerned. Unfortunately Beginning Stages isn&amp;rsquo;t available in surround DVD-Audio format. However their second album &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?albumID=1110014&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Together We Are Heavy&lt;/a&gt; is indeed available in incredible crystal clear DVD-A surround format but it is probably half as good :(.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These albums are available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://rhapsody-app.listen.com/rhapsody_tour/page1.jsp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;, although not in surround sound.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autumn Fall Foliage 2004</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/autumn-fall-foliage-2004/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2004 04:32:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/autumn-fall-foliage-2004/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this and haven&amp;rsquo;t been out there, well, you already missed the biggest blast of colors in Adirondacks (NY). On &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foliagenetwork.com/reports/northeast_us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;US east coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.state.me.us/doc/foliage/report/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and an odd little dot in the heart of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adirondacks.com/fallreport.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adirondacks&lt;/a&gt; are two places where the amazing fall colors appears first. Last year, just by pure fortune, &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/autumn-fall-foliage-long-drives-2003/&#34;&gt;I was in Adirondacks&lt;/a&gt; and in one of the first mornings I saw a sudden blast of color everywhere in the region. So we took the flight over 46 tall mountains (and the countless small ones) that makes up this amazingly beautiful area. The aerial views we saw from the small plane flying low were definitely the best fall foliage view I’ve ever seen (and for the record, I’d been &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/autumn-fall-foliage-long-drives-2002/&#34;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; quite &lt;a href=&#34;https://picasaweb.google.com/111712720654017421562/AutumnFallFoliageLongDrives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a lot&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, last weekend was the day when colors had peaked again at Adirondacks and after a week of blazing show that nature had put there, the area is now past peak (along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foliage-vermont.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; and much of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newhampshire.com/foliage/index.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; – which is often compared with China for the best in fall foliage in entire world because of the diversity of trees). But if you plan well, you can still chase the fall foliage on the East coast for this entire month and enjoy the blazing colors in truly awesome settings! After some researching in to my collection of links and reviewing fall foliage reports from various states, I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Yo9hEhJ1ZnVlRHVXpDQS1VWTQ/edit?usp=sharing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this Excel sheet&lt;/a&gt; for the approximate times for fall foliage peak colors. So go out and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sharpreader.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SharpReader&lt;/a&gt; to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/post-files/2004/09/sharpreader.zip&#34;&gt;my news (opml zip)&lt;/a&gt;. This is a small free app that has amazingly survived like an unevolving little insect in an environment where new species with more beef keeps coming. But this thing is still not extinct. I run around to look for an option with more features and end up at using SharpReader again and again. I&amp;rsquo;m though more interested that it dies away for one reason - the author isn&amp;rsquo;t publishing source code and at the same time he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have time to improve it by himself. It has pretty limited feature set but its designed so that its just barely enough to keep you alive. I tried to switch to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rssbandit.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RSS BandIt&lt;/a&gt; just to find that its fat feature list had missed some hearty points. Yesterday I looked at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Omega Reader&lt;/a&gt; and was very excited that finally this will call for an end of SharpReader - just to find that its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/omea/features/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;super-fat features&lt;/a&gt; comes with same numbers of bugs. So I&amp;rsquo;m still continue to live with SharpReader virus. Its an example how to design your programs so that your users wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like it and at the same time can&amp;rsquo;t give it up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.x-setup.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;X-Setup&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most comprehensive Windows tweaking utility. I always end up spending half a day enabling all the hidden advanced settings using this thing. Fortunately it provides Recording mode and creation of a REG file. This is really cool because now with just a click I can make any XP/2003 machine more geekier and end lots of &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; annoyances. If you are interested you too can use my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/MiscDevFiles/blob/master/source/XSetup%20-%20All.reg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;final REG file&lt;/a&gt;. It would enable a whole range of features – everything from showing additional control panel applets, using double pans in explorer, removing Outlook attachment restrictions, showing file attributes in tooltip, adding new items in Explorer context menu, removing Shutdown Reason UI, kill everything quickly when shutting down and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/BrowserHistoryAnalyser.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/BrowserHistoryAnalyser-300x174.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;BrowserHistoryAnalyser&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;174&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-892&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/BrowserHistoryAnalyser-300x174.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/BrowserHistoryAnalyser-1024x595.jpg 1024w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/BrowserHistoryAnalyser.jpg 1280w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to preserve logs of my browser history. Apart from recalling useful webpages I&amp;rsquo;d discovered, it helps to build kind of &amp;ldquo;journal&amp;rdquo; reflecting problems I was facing, things I was in to, things I was shopping and so on. An ability to look back and see what you were up to in any point of time is really important, not just useful. Unfortunately there is no easy way to export history from IE or Firefox, let alone query that data in an useful way. So this is the program I&amp;rsquo;d been putting some time on and off. The first version I&amp;rsquo;d made meant only for my personal and was a quick and dirty program in VB6 more then 5 years ago. Its latest incarnation is now rewritten from scratch in .Net 2.0 Beta1 and provides loads of functionalities in nice user interface. You can do all of followings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the browser history in to MS Access database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search your browser history with speed like Google&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge several history databases i to one (useful if you used multiple machines)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at all the queries you performed on Google, MSN and Yahoo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics of how many websites you visit a day, how many unique URLs and domains you have visited so far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to filter &amp;ldquo;noice&amp;rdquo; and random popup URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics of how much time you spend per page, how much time you spend per day in browsing websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chart the statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture of this new version is fairly extensible and you can plug-in more modules as you go. I&amp;rsquo;ll be implementing more public plug-in architecture and using plain XML files instead of MS Access databases and FireFox support (this is becoming important for me because I&amp;rsquo;ve 100% switched over to FireFox). So this is not yet the &amp;ldquo;release&amp;rdquo; version. Also note that you need .Net Framework Beta 2.0 Beta1 + VB.Net resource Kit if you want to compile the code. But results are beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;obsolete&#34;&gt;
  Warning: This program was written circa Nov 2004 and last updated around Mar 2005. It is currently considered obsolete. There are no plans to update it and no support is provided.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/BrowserHistoryAnalyzer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BrowserHistoryAnalyzer is now archived at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing With DataViews</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dealing-with-dataviews/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2004 18:50:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dealing-with-dataviews/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never liked being forced to use DataView just to speed up my searches. Why not DataTable.Select() have an overload to generate internal indexes and do some smart things? But anyway, most people searching DataSet eventually would realizes that performance really sucks and they have no choice but to use DataViews, sometime whole bunch of it prepared for all sorts of queries you want to fire. Here are two things you should watch out (&lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemDataDataRowViewClassDeleteTopic.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MSDN docs&lt;/a&gt; aren’t clear about this):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you call myDataView(someIndex).Delete anywhere in your code, watch out that you do not access any other rows with index &amp;gt; someIndex. If you do, you might either get a run time error or even worse, you might be accessing row underneath that’s different then you actually wanted without any error. Another corollary: &lt;strong&gt;Never delete rows in DataView in forward loop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are changing/adding row in DataTable or other DataViews, do not forget to call row.BeginEdit and row.EndEdit. If you don’t, your changes will not appear in other views you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, performance gains through DataView is still pretty sweet thing to have 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DataSet, not XML</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dataset-not-xml/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2004 18:09:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/dataset-not-xml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you need to store certain data in file, most of the time you will obviously think about storing it as XML file. Then soon you start drawing XML schemas and think about generating XSDs&amp;hellip; Well, stop! You might be making same mistake as many other people. The better idea is to design XML schema which is &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconloadingdatasetfromxml.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;loadable in DataSet&lt;/a&gt; rather then just &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemxmlxmldocumentclasstopic.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XMLDocument&lt;/a&gt;. This has tremendous advantages then your custom schema:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of thinking in hierarchical terms, you can now think in relational terms. I&amp;rsquo;ve often found that this simplifies lots of things. This means you can think how you will be storing your data in tables rather then XML hierarchies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schema generation gets simplified: You can draw actual database schemas using drag and drop in Access visually, set various properties for fields and generate XML schema using my utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can load your XML file right in to DataSet, create various &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/_mapping_xsd_relationships_to_dataset_relationships.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;relationships&lt;/a&gt; and access your data far more easily and with less code then directly using XMLDocument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have stuff in DataSet, you can do data bindings directly for quick demos or even use typed datasets - which is far more safer then always late bound XMLDocument objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In future, if you change your mind (and in most cases you will) to store your data in high performance databases rather then plain XML files, using DataSet in first place makes your job far more easier. Using DataSet compatible schemas allows you support plain XML files as well as real databases as your storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use SQL Server, its still a good idea to include possible support for Access mdb file along with plain XML file as your storage. Unlike plain XML files, Access single file databases allows you to fire far more complex queries rather then just XPath, generate reports write VBA scripts, set constraints, use security features and use other tons of utilities out there. Using DataSet compatible schemas lets you do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of dataset will let you migrate your application as becoming a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=Net%20Lead.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groove tool&lt;/a&gt; with far more ease. Once your app can sit in Groove transceiver, it would suddenly become a marvellous magic collaboration product! However note that Groove has not included their ADO.Net support in their 3.0 version but there are rumours that they eventually will. Currently the only way to have it is to use Groove 2.5 or upgrade from it to 3.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you manually enter data in your XML file (usually you might have to for unit tests, bug repro etc), you can do it in Access tables which is far more easier and save whole database as XML using my utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might make you wonder is there is any negative points in using DataSet compatible schemas. There are some, indeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some data which is inherently hierarchical are better represented using custom schemas. Trying to fit in relational table structure will cause to create several &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ehow.com/how_13626_define-many-many.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;many-to-many map tables&lt;/a&gt; and complicate the whole thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If XML file becomes large, there ways to read it using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/02/14/perlsax.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SAX parser&lt;/a&gt; rather then loading whole file in memory. Using DataSet directly will always load the whole file in memory and in general uses more of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom XML schemas are more &amp;ldquo;purer&amp;rdquo; to share across the platforms. However if you plan to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mono-project.com/about/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;, it already supports DataSets and that won’t be a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>When .Net Framework 2.0 Beta Messes You Up</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/when-net-framework-2-0-beta-messes-you-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2004 04:02:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/when-net-framework-2-0-beta-messes-you-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=916ec067-8bdc-4737-9430-6cec9667655c&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;.Net Framework 2.0 Beta&lt;/a&gt; and suddenly &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VS2K3.Net&lt;/a&gt; refuses to attach to your existing 1.1 apps with a very cool error message “Unable to attach to process”, don’t get panic! Looks like side-by-side promise of Framework versions doesn’t work in some rare cases (which somehow I always get in to). Unfortunately you can’t uninstall 2.0 (even though it gets installed in separate folder, core DLLs such as mscorlib.dll is already replaced by 2.0 version). The best way to make things work is to live with it and add this little snippet in your &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconapplicationconfigurationfiles.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;[myapp].exe.config&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &#34;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/gngrfstartup.asp&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;startup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;
      &amp;lt;supportedRuntime version=&#34;v1.1.4322&#34;/&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/startup&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better way is, off course, install betas only in your &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtualpc/default.mspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VPC&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: If you ask what was that rare situation: This happens with &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=Net%20Lead.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Groove tools&lt;/a&gt; you write with 100% managed code. In this case, you expose your &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.groove.net/dev/currentbuild/platform/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=DMDComponents.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DMD&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/callnetfrcom.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CCW&lt;/a&gt; which Groove loads dynamically using ProgID and somehow it gets bind to 2.0 version. One more thing, I’ve heard that 2.0+ Frameworks will upgrade existing framework version rather then getting installed side-by-side. That might be it! In any case, your VS2003.Net will get screwed up, so above step is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Besides doing everything that you ever wanted from a thing called Task Manager (even showing open files for every process), it has one of the sweetest option that your application should provide: Replace Windows native [equivalent thing]! I just keep wishing if there had been free and with-source Calculators and Explorers and everything else Windows that I can just replace with a click like this and move on rather then &lt;a href=&#34;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2002/09/27.html#a1547&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;waiting for a decade&lt;/a&gt; on Microsoft to improve their &lt;a href=&#34;http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.windows.off-topic/5339&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;age old featureless&lt;/a&gt; apps. So when you are getting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stardock.com/products/windowblinds/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cool skinable Windows&lt;/a&gt;?

      <title>Recursion Enabled Task Progress Dialog</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/recursion-enabled-task-progress-dialog/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2004 10:37:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/recursion-enabled-task-progress-dialog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress-300x180.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;TaskProgress&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-903&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress-300x180.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/TaskProgress.jpg 344w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an advanced progress dialog which can be shared among method calls which can call each other recursively. Each method call gets a portion of the total progress so we can see some continuous progress instead of only top level method progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is implemented by singleton version of TaskProgress using static public member which each method can use without being aware of other methods. This component keeps tracks of call recursion in a Stack and allocates progress bar range to each of the calls. Also the point of interest is the time remaining calculation which, if not sure, would show min-max range like &amp;ldquo;Time Remaining: 2 mins to 7 mins&amp;rdquo;. Please note that this is .Net 2.0 Beta1 code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample code for usage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;code-block&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
/*** Pseudo Code ***/
public void Button1_Click(...) 
{       
    Progress.Show(0, 100);                  
    Progress.AllocateRangeForCallee(0,25);    //child updates would be mapped to range 0 to 25       
    Callee1();  //Callee would also attempt to show progress dialog too       
    Progress.Unload();      //ref count =0, this will actually unload 
} 

private void Callee1()

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; found that! That song in the movie &lt;a href=&#34;http://http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;American Beauty&lt;/a&gt; with rain falling in one of the last scenes is &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/song/default.asp?songID=609626&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Let It Bring You Down By Neil Young&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/song/default.asp?songID=716366&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;one by Annie Lennox&lt;/a&gt; is much better. It was buzzing in my head since quite some time now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Venus Transit Tomorrow</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/venus-transit-2004-08-06/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2004 23:45:45 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/venus-transit-2004-08-06/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one is not a spectacular but its interesting because it&amp;rsquo;s rare and because of history. Specifically, in old times (pre 1900s), people used this rare event to measure distance between Earth and Sun. Infect astronomers didn&amp;rsquo;t knew this distance from a long time, so they invented so-called &amp;ldquo;1 Astronomical Unit (AU)&amp;rdquo; when they want to refer to this distance. In old times, everything was measured relative to AU, for example Venus is 0.7AU away from Sun. Venus Transit helped to resole this. Plus it also helped to figure out Sun&amp;rsquo;s diameter. Now just out of curiosity, I thought, how would Venus transit could help in determining Sun-Earth distance and Sun&amp;rsquo;s diameter? Answer is simple enough: Have two people watched it from different latitudes on Earth, make a triangle, use simple trigonometry and you get the distance! &lt;a href=&#34;http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/sunearthday/2004/vt_view_observatories_2004.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nasa has put up a detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of little math in involved in this clever technique. Then This is, of course, still less accurate then modern ways of radars and satellites. Venus orbits around Sun in just 0.6 years. Then one would think why transits are so rare? Well, answer is, Venus&amp;rsquo;s orbit isn&amp;rsquo;t in the same plane as Earth, so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty rare for Sun-Venus-Earth to get in one straight line, usually every little over hundres years or so. Apart from that, this transit won&amp;rsquo;t visually appeal to most but if you had those special safe glasses to view sun eclipse, you might have a look between 11:05AM to 11:25AM on US East Coast on June 8, 2004. More info at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exploratorium.edu/venusEC/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Exploratorium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.astronomy.no/venus080604.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;astronomy.no&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NotepadX Preview Is Out!</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/notepadx-preview-is-out/</link>

      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/notepadx-preview-is-out/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the thing I needed since like 3 years now and I started writing it by myself early 2003. But I knew something like this should have been already out there and I was probably wasting mytime in doing it all over again. So I decided to write several reusable application components rather then app itself and then build the app as a &amp;ldquo;demo&amp;rdquo; of components. I used NotepadX for about an year as a solo user while evolving and writing more code to make it better. And just now I felt it&amp;rsquo;s pretty sophisticated and stable enough for other people to preview it. For non-geeky users, NotepadX is a powerful utility to maintain their data. For programmers it&amp;rsquo;s lots of reusable interesting source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NotepadX is a powerful program to let you to keep your notes in hierarchically organized categories. Also it not just allows you to create rich text/ plain text notes but also the notes which are like Worksheet or a treeview! It also supports encrypted secured notes so you can save your passwords and sensitive information safely. You can also create read-only notes and pass it around. The Edit-In-Word allows you to use Word for rich text formatting in case my basic editor didn&amp;rsquo;t fit your needs. All your notes get saved in to one single XML file and for programmers, you have entire source code, several reusable components and nice object model if you need to tweak it. This has been my pass time project and several features are missing right now which I might work on in future, such as: integration with OneNote, search feature, export feature, merging of several notes etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IE Most Wanted Tools</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2004 23:32:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/ie-sqaurefree-booklets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;these Internet Explorer &amp;ldquo;power tools&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;d wanted since soooo long. These little things called booklets are actually just shortcuts pointing to JavaScript which you can install by just drag and drop on your Links bar in IE (check View &amp;gt; Toolbars menu if you don&amp;rsquo;t see Links bar). If you want to save time from having browse through each of these things, you can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download my selection&lt;/a&gt; and extract them in to your Documents and Settings$$!Your_Login_name]\Favorites\Links folder and use them right away. You can do pretty neat things on a web page you are viewing once you have these little things. Some samples: View passwords, remove length limitations in a form, remove JavaScript, re-enable context menu, remove images and flashy stuff, show hidden fields in form, enable fields in form which are disabled, show borders of invisible tables, grayscale whole page (nice to have if page had weird colors), show HTTP headers, show HTML class when you roll over a block, force page wrap, lowercase everything, restore redirected links, view cookies, go to referer, sort table, number rows in table and more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d nothing new to listen to but then just brewed up this triplet which nicely works out on these winter days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?albumID=117257&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;A Winter&amp;rsquo;s Solstice VI&lt;/a&gt;: A Windham Hill Sampler - A nice classical album. Just by look at the track names like Northern Lights, January Stars, Snow Dance, This Clearness Of Light - you know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be good :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?albumID=1038875&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;The Very Best Of Yanni&lt;/a&gt;: Yet another good (if not as great) keyboard fiesta. Nice tracks: Flight Of Fantasy, In The Morning Light, The Mermaid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/album/default.asp?albumID=1029454&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;Maroon&lt;/a&gt;: Surprisingly good for those &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo; times when there is too much to do and absolutely nothing do. This my Barenaked Ladies Firsts which probably one can never get tired of hearing one more time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen As: Random &lt;a href=&#34;http://rhaplinks.listen.com/rhaplink?playlist=Winter%20Solstice%20and%20Yanni&amp;cobrand=40120&amp;tracks=5889404,5889405,5889406,5889407,5889408,5889409,5889410,5889411,5889412,5889413,5889414,5889415,5889416,5889417,5889418,4547239,4547240,4547241,4547242,4547243,4547244,4547245,4547246,4547247,4547248,4547249,4547250,4547251,4547253,5839283,5839284,5839285,5839286,5839287,5839288,5839289,5839290,5839291,5839292,5839293,5839294&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;The entire play list&lt;/a&gt; is available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://music.lycos.com/rhapsody/&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chinese New Year Festivities</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/chinese-new-year-festivities/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2004 21:04:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/chinese-new-year-festivities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While my wife would be celebrating &lt;a href=&#34;http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/topicsub1.htm?once=true&amp;&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt; on more native land of Hong Kong, there would be quite a few events happening in NEw York city. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://gonyc.about.com/cs/holidays/a/chinesenewyear.htm&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;big parade&lt;/a&gt; is on Sunday 25th in Chinatown with dragons and lions, all red and gold, along with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.taipei.org/even/newyearevent/chinesenewyear.html&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;other events&lt;/a&gt;. Chinatown-Online gives nice little &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chinatown-online.com/year/year.shtml&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;info on traditions of Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt; and other festivities dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major deal of New Year is, of course, lavish food festivities. There is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://ccbany.org/restaurant_list.html&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;suprisingly large number of restaurants&lt;/a&gt; in NYC which will be offering special New Year meals, but here are some select few places to get the Year of the Monkey off to a good start (Chanoodle is the most recommended):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chanoodle - (212) 349-1495 - 79 Mulberry Street (Canal Street), Chinatown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congee - (212) 965-5028 - 98 Bowery (Near Hester Street)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dim Sum Go Go - (212) 732-0797 - 5 East Broadway (Chatham Square)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funky Broome - (212) 941-8628 - 176 Mott Street (Broome Street)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joe&amp;rsquo;s Ginger - 212) 966-6613 - 113 Mott Street (Near Hester Street)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ping&amp;rsquo;s Seafood - (212) 602-9988 - 22 Mott Street (Near Mosco Street)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunrise 27 - 212) 219-8498 - 27 Division Street (Near Market Street)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Courtesy: NYTimes)&lt;/em&gt; However my personal choice would be the Rainbow platter at Penang, the Malaysian restaurant on Rt. 10. Have a good new year! Sing Dan Fai Lok!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you live on East Coast and if you looked in to West in last few hours you might have seen a real bright blob of light. It&amp;rsquo;s so bright and has &amp;ldquo;burning aura&amp;rdquo; (literally looks like flames) around it that I thought it will soon fall down as huge shooting star. So I just fired up my copy of TheSky software to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on and came out with some neat surprise. Well, this is Venus and for next month or so it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be visible long after sunsets and would stay pretty well above horizon (which is not very usual for Venus). With it&amp;rsquo;s current magnitude of -4.0 that&amp;rsquo;s way way too bright for normal night sky standards and it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be even more brighter. If you trace path of Venus, it seems Venus and Moon both comes really really close (almost touching) on 23nd Feb, 2004 at around 17:34 which also happens to be Sunset time! And the beauty of the whole scene during this Sunset is that it would be really nice crescent moon. So watch out and put this date and time on your calendar!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This event is slowing down every year and so for some people it would be a reason not to care and for others it would be a reason to care even more, because next year it will be more slower :). But it&amp;rsquo;s still nice to see shooting stars with some predictability. This year, the peak time on East coast would be on 19th November between 12:00 to 2:30AM which is little earlier then past years. But again my wishes have already came true this year so don&amp;rsquo;t have lots of wishes to make :). Nasa has &lt;a href=&#34;http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/estimator.html&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;really cool graphical estimator&lt;/a&gt; for pick intensity for most cities in the world. For times on West coast and more details, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.physlink.com/News/111103LeonidMeteors.cfm&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;check out this press release&lt;/a&gt;. Just don&amp;rsquo;t expect something like that image of meteor shower on this site!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:red;font-size:125%&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nce upon a time, far far away from any real world you know, there lived a sparkle of light. Always trying to hide away in the kingdom of dark, it looked to the stars in the night. On one such magical night, it finally tried to look for itself in all the worlds that existed. And with the lightning of awe, it indeed found the one as unreal as itself in its own lone world. The two were far apart, unable to touch and see but still able to long and feel. They moved towards each other for they saw the face of love without seeing each other. Even when they fell, the face made them to stand up and walk again. And on one of the star covered dawns when the Sun was about to light up the sky, they met where the ocean meets the sky. Then they got bound to each other forever to make the wings and they flew away.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally bought my new keyboard synthesizer - something I wanted since last few months. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail/0,6373,CNTID%253D21387%2526CTID%253D205300%2526VNM%253DLIVE%2526AFLG%253DY%2526LGFL%253DN,00.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Yamaha EZ250i&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.instrumentpro.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;InstrumentPro&lt;/a&gt; (they seems to be the only one bundling the survival kit along with). This one is suitable for beginners as well as advanced users who needs a perfect piano experience. Infect it&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate machine available for learner in the market. This one is an upgrade over EZ30 and has just arrived in last July. It can be connected to computer right away, has 400+ voices, accurate Grand Piano sounds, built-in Education Suit among several other things. Sweeeet!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autumn Fall Foliage Long Drives 2003</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/autumn-fall-foliage-long-drives-2003/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cool to be in mountains when fall is just still arriving and you are among the first to feel it. This year my First Of Autumn hikes happened in Adirondacks. This area in upper state New York is probably among the most scenic part on East Coast. You got choice of 46 high peaks to climb (a High Peak is a mountain taller then 4000 ft) apart from countless small mountains and hills, several small and huge lakes to canoe and kayak or just relax on cruise, quite a few waterfalls and quint towns. The best part is you can even take small plane like Cessna 152 and fly over those mountains covered with fresh yellow, red, violet colors. It&amp;rsquo;s probably some of the most scenic experience you can ever have in this part of the country. But behold! Fall is just beginning. The next best thing to do is probably long drives on colorful lonely snaky roads passing through mountains, valleys and lakes. But.. where would you go? Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the best picks for autumn fall foliage road trips!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Citysearch has &lt;a href=&#34;http://local.msn.com/special/archive/travel_fall.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;their picks of top 10 fall foliage spots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://gorp.away.com/gorp/features/fall/fall_00.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GORP&amp;rsquo;s Autumn kickoff&lt;/a&gt;. They have the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gorp.away.com/gorp/activity/rv.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;great sets of scenic driving routes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.escortedfallfoliagetours.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;commercial fall tours site&lt;/a&gt; but they have good &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.escortedfallfoliagetours.com/adventure/adventure.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;adventure section&lt;/a&gt; and you can &amp;ldquo;steal&amp;rdquo; some of their iteneries 🙂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Best also have &lt;a href=&#34;http://americasbestonline.com/fall.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;small list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are in New Jersey, pick your road trip from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.state.nj.us/travel/driving_tours_fall/falltours.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this great routes through out NJ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last thing: How would you know when and where it&amp;rsquo;s peak of fall colors? There are 3 sites which can tell you when it&amp;rsquo;s time to go: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.foliagenetwork.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Foliage Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fs.fed.us/news/fallcolors/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;USDA Forest Services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.travelnotes.org/Travel/sep16.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this other site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bnlmusic.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Barenaked Ladies&lt;/a&gt; will be performing live at New York on 22nd Oct. These guys concerts (there&amp;rsquo;s no female members in the band - for the unawares) are among the most fun live events, so don&amp;rsquo;t delay in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/00003730D89B9217?brand=&amp;amp;artistid=749433&amp;amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;amp;minorcatid=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;getting tickets&lt;/a&gt;! Even more, these are the few of rare artists who prefer to perform live and then put the song in a album rather then other way around. I didn&amp;rsquo;t thought they would be doing any tours. &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/musicvideos/player/default.asp?videoID=173975&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pinch me&lt;/a&gt; if I&amp;rsquo;m still asleep 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Star Trek Voyager is off-air since past few months. So I went to Netflix, my DVD subscription, just to find that Paramount hasn&amp;rsquo;t produced DVDs yet. So I went to Amazon to buy VHS version, just to find that the video cassets are one episod per casset (consider having 150+ episodes). So all these have almost ruined my hopes to get back to Voyager, just when I needed the most. As my last resort, I looked up in Kazza and found some of the cool episodes floating around but it gonna take days to get them. Moral of the story: If it is still on-air in your area, watch it while you still can. Don&amp;rsquo;t mess with your luck.&lt;/p&gt;

This is little unusual because even the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webster-hall.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Webster Hall&lt;/a&gt; is kind of the top dance club in the City, I never heard any concerts happening there. But probably thats what makes this cool. Check for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nintendofusiontour.com/tour_dates.jsp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tickets and other tour locations&lt;/a&gt;. But beaware, tickets are being distributed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ticketmaster.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the worst ticketing site in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Awesome Destinations</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/awesome-destinations-and-times-to-visit-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2003 06:18:53 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently went to Sierra Club&amp;rsquo;s meeting/presentation on California&amp;rsquo;s Route 1. This road trip certainly seems to be the queen of all. The presenter been touring this route every couple of years since last 3 decades and had some really awesome photographs - some taken in different seasons and time of the days and some even different decades! Here are some tips from the guru himself: The road trip to CA1 can be done any month, never let weather stop you. Still if you are too picky, in summer (through September) it&amp;rsquo;s kind of hot. From December to March is good time except that El-Nino may strike the Pacific coast and parts of CA1 suddenly merges in to ocean, yet Feb-March is the best time. This is also the time when you can see lots of white whales in the ocean floating around while watching sunset in Pacific Ocean. The good place to stay overnight on this route is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raggedpointinn.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ragged Point Inn&lt;/a&gt;. You might want to frequently take exists in between, specifically for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hearstcastle.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;San Simeon Castle&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s good idea to stay around this gorgeous huge architecture (they have even special tour for just bathrooms among others!). To stay around this building is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sspines.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;San Simeon Pines&lt;/a&gt; is a good resort. The route is 90 miles long and totally worth an entire day trip. While in presentation, I also stumbled upon list of really gorgeous places to visit in United States. They are special because they have specific times when you should be there. Also they are very diverse (from flower covered moutains to canyons in Utah!). If you get a chance, don&amp;rsquo;t even think about missing out on them. I certainly won&amp;rsquo;t :). Here&amp;rsquo;s my filtered list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bryce Canyon National Park, &lt;strong&gt;Utah&lt;/strong&gt; Canyon valleys partially gets covered in snow. Not for faint hearted.Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Jan/Feb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cottonwood Lake, &lt;strong&gt;Alaska&lt;/strong&gt; Clear waters and ice formations in lake like a huge starfish from end to endBest Time: &lt;strong&gt;Feb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glenn Canyon National Recreation Area, &lt;strong&gt;Arizona&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Feb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tehachapi Mountains, &lt;strong&gt;California&lt;/strong&gt; Absolute gorgeous mountains completely covered with flowers. Yes, just like you had dreamed once :). Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isla Espirita Santo, Sea of Cortes, &lt;strong&gt;Maxico&lt;/strong&gt; urrr&amp;hellip; this one is non-US.Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painted Hills, &lt;strong&gt;Oregon&lt;/strong&gt; yes, hills that actually looks like someone painted them outBest Time: &lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elives Chasm, Grand Canyon National Park, &lt;strong&gt;Arizona&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;June&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moraine Lake, Banff National Park, &lt;strong&gt;Alberta&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Aug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cohutta Wilderness Area, &lt;strong&gt;Georgia&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Sep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kennebec River, &lt;strong&gt;Main&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Oct&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snake River, &lt;strong&gt;Wyoming&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Nov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yosemite Falls, Yosemite National Park, &lt;strong&gt;California&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Nov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talkeetna Mountains, &lt;strong&gt;Alaska&lt;/strong&gt; A special place where you can see Aurora Borealis! Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Nov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;West Indian Manatees, &lt;strong&gt;Florida&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Dec&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owens Valley near Laws, &lt;strong&gt;California&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Dec/Jan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weddell Sea, &lt;strong&gt;Antarctica&lt;/strong&gt; urrrr&amp;hellip; this is non-US, again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannon Beach, Ecola State Park, &lt;strong&gt;Oregon&lt;/strong&gt; Best Time: &lt;strong&gt;Dec/Jan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Things To Remember When Building Your PC</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/custom-pc-checklist-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2003 06:48:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/custom-pc-checklist-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently upgraded my custom build 2.5 year old beast. When I started out that time, I wanted to make something really powerful, enviable and which kind of had everything. After burning $3500 in this endeavor I enjoyed owning something that exceeded what Microsoft and others just recently &amp;ldquo;innovated&amp;rdquo; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/evaluation/products.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Media Center PC&lt;/a&gt;. But this time upgrade wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy and I kept messing up things many times and calling up other gurus. So here&amp;rsquo;s the list for the benefit of someone not-so-skilled: 1. Usually motherboards have 3 special screws that would touch the chassis and provide the grounding. Don&amp;rsquo;t mix up (aha, screw up) those screws. 2. When you lay PC on its side (motherboard top facing you), remember all IDE cable&amp;rsquo;s red-line side faces you but floppy&amp;rsquo;s faces down. If you mess this up, drives won&amp;rsquo;t be detected and you might keep thinking that you blew up power supply and run to buy another one. 3. Power cables to all IDE drives would have yellow side facing you and red side facing IDE cable&amp;rsquo;s red-line. Usually you can&amp;rsquo;t plug other way, unless, uhhh&amp;hellip; you push really hard! 4. It&amp;rsquo;s important to see which drive is master and which one is slave (ALWAYS look at the jumper settings before you put drives in bays wire everything up). I didn&amp;rsquo;t bothered and just keep trying until they all were detected (real reason being I&amp;rsquo;d lost my flashlight). This won&amp;rsquo;t blow up your drives but it&amp;rsquo;s very unreliable. 5. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to connect CD digital and DVD SPDF connectors to sound card. Former allows digital ripping of audio CDs in MP3s and later allows Dolby Digital sound if you have the card that supports that and have hooked up to Home Theater system. Also if you want to listen modem noises on speakers (or home theater as in my case), don&amp;rsquo;t forget to connect modem and sound card. Many cheap modems don&amp;rsquo;t support this any longer however. 6. If power light blinks then probably you have power supply set on 230V (European style) rather then 115V (US style).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Sep 9, Sunset is at 7:16 PM and moonrise is also at 7:16 PM. Cool right? Good way to see this would be at &lt;a href=&#34;http://members.aol.com/visitnj/visitnjhighpoint.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;High Point State Park&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&#34;http://newyork.sierraclub.org/outings/Schedules/SepHikes.htm#Sep%206%20(Sat)%20FOREST%20RESTORATION%20WORKSHOP%20-%20GRETA%20MOULTON%20TRACT%20AT%20HIGH%20ROCK&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;special hike from Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt;. My preference is former, undoubtably the best place in NJ to see this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Visit To The Temple</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/iskon-temple-west-virginia-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2003 08:09:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/iskon-temple-west-virginia-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d to just help my neighbour to find her run-away cat. Now a last blogbit&amp;hellip; before I really really go to bed! This Labor Day weekend I was thinking about spending 3 days in programming few stuff I&amp;rsquo;d planned but such things just can&amp;rsquo;t happen. Suddenly a plan came around out of nowhere for 12+ hours of road trip to West Virginia and a visit to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iskcon.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ISKCON&lt;/a&gt; temple. Submitting to spontaneous weird idea seems to be my weakness. This one was weird because, well, who can think of visiting an ISKCON temple out of nowhere? While I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated to ISKCON (or for that matter any religious organization whatsoever), I was curious about them anyway (watching Hare Krishna group dancing on Leicester Square in London is very cool) and so I joined my gang. This indeed turned out to be great road trip. We almost started at sun rise, passed through valleys and mountains covered with mist and made few stops. The temple located on the mountain top in hilly state of West Virginia has some good views. We also realized that day was little special being the last day of a festival called Paryushan from Jain religion and first day of another festival Ganesh Chaturthi and the last day when the temple remains open until 8 PM and a day when free feast is served and of course, it was the last day of summer. As if all these coincidences weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, I ran in to one of my classmates in the temple who had left his job to be a full time ISKCON person serving as deputy director of a charity hospital (it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how I keep meeting my classmates by coincidences. Last time I met one in a strip club, this time it was in a temple! And we always say this first to each other: &amp;ldquo;what the hack you doing here?&amp;rdquo;). We also took the tour of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palaceofgold.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Palace Of Gold&lt;/a&gt; which is the memorial built for the founder of ISKCON. It&amp;rsquo;s funny though to build a memorial buried under gold for a person who probably spent his entire life fighting against materialistic world and achieving nirvana. You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dotphoto.com/go.asp?l=sytel&amp;amp;AID=1009419&amp;amp;Pres=Y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;view some photos of this trip&lt;/a&gt;, some are really cool including one with beetles procreating right inside the rose!&lt;/p&gt;

This is happening for the 3rd time. Everytime I read this book I get until this chapter and then eventually give up. This time I tried to track down the fault and realized this chapter is so much unorganized and has apparently unrelated thoughts, though interesting - which keeps me coming back to it. Okay&amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s start again. Shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I go to bed, few more bits&amp;hellip; This is to announce that this year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mtv.com/onair/vma/2003/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VMA&lt;/a&gt; sucked. I used to see this show for it being totally different from other award functions (i.e. freaky, weird, explicit and eye-popping). It seems to be the general opinion that if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mtv.com/onair/vma/2003/postshow/flipbooks/on_stage/topflip.jhtml?c=3&amp;amp;pf=/onair/vma/2003/postshow/flipbooks/on_stage/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Britney-Madonna&amp;rsquo;s kiss&lt;/a&gt;, this would have been the worse so far.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mars Viewing</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/mars-viewing-aug-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2003 06:30:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/mars-viewing-aug-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just saw the red planet through my 4.5&amp;rdquo; telescope and 10mm eye piece. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.msnbc.com/news/957424.asp?0cv=CB20&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Unlike it was advertised on several web sites&lt;/a&gt;, no, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get as big as moon when looking through modest telescope. Infect there&amp;rsquo;s barely any difference when I&amp;rsquo;d looked at it through same scope in last couple of years. So I just went in to &lt;a href=&#34;http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some number crunching using fact sheet at Nasa&amp;rsquo;s web site&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems that Mars should look (at best) 30% more brighter and around 40% bigger then I&amp;rsquo;d seen couple of years ago. Now the catch is that when looking through telescope with above spec (which is pretty beyond modest 70mm stuff), Mars would normally look like a bright tiny disk. So 40% increase would make that tiny disk little bigger - but still a tiny. To make it look as big as Moon you would need increment of 1000% or more and that&amp;rsquo;s not going to achievable just by Mars coming closer - it&amp;rsquo;s possible only though much much bigger scopes. So my conclusion is that news sites and emails that kept circulating were pretty misleading to public. Though the good part is that lots of people suddenly got interested in astronomy. Infect one of my friend was so hopeful that he has put a $100 bet with me on whether Mars would look as big as moon on 27th August with bare naked eyes! So I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely disappointed with this hoax, at least someone would get some money :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cool Albums Of The Season</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/albums-of-the-season-aug-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2003 19:52:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/albums-of-the-season-aug-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some from shopping list of past few months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Artist - Album]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linkin Park - Meteora&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evanescence - Fallen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audioslave - Audioslave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macy Gray - On How Life Is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barenaked Ladies - Rock Spectacle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Strings - Take me away (into the night)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evanescence&amp;rsquo;s Fallen is probably the best thing came out this year. Audioslave is raw, hard and grungy. How Macy Gray came in to my list? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;d written bad things about Meteora previously but when you are in real need for extreme screaming, lots of hatred and hard hard hard stuff these guys seems to fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just watched &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/theshow/Episode035/default.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MSDN TV&amp;rsquo;s new episode on Managed Code&lt;/a&gt;. The topic is pretty trivial for me but what&amp;rsquo;s exciting is to see one person talking and seating there. I remember my years as a rebellious programmer when followers were few and swimming opposite the popular currents wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. In all-Unix all-C++ organization I&amp;rsquo;d heavily pushed for tools and style I believed in - even if it meant taking over entire responsibility and work load on me. All those tools that I chose, used and appreciated for the vision it embedded, looked separate pieces of great ideas which just seem to happen to came on my way&amp;hellip; until there was one day when I read a magazine article and came to know there was really only one person behind all of those and all these years: Anders Hejlsberg. Those separate pieces of vision now seems to make a complete picture and so you can imagine how I would have stand in awe of him. As far as world of programming is concerned, Anders is my hero.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this world of the Greater Being, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m at play&amp;hellip; like a little kid. With all my sense of wonder and curiosity&amp;hellip; walking on my knees to get close, see and feel everything that has been put around me&amp;hellip; and smile for all those good things that I find. And when I&amp;rsquo;m just moving around, there are moments when things are not the way I would have wanted&amp;hellip; sometime when I would have really wanted. Some of the worst moments of my life constitutes of those when the people I&amp;rsquo;d admired I see falling apart and I can&amp;rsquo;t do anything about it&amp;hellip; when someone you cared is dieing and you can do nothing about it&amp;hellip; Those moments&amp;hellip; when I just want to look up in the sky and pretend that I don&amp;rsquo;t exist&amp;hellip; trying to convince myself that it&amp;rsquo;s ok&amp;hellip; I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m betrayed with anger bursting out every inch of my body&amp;hellip; But then when I&amp;rsquo;m all low and down, there&amp;rsquo;s always something that happens&amp;hellip; like someone struck the new string on the guitar that I&amp;rsquo;d never heard before&amp;hellip; wiping out all my doubts with just that one stroke of note. So I look around to find the one but I can&amp;rsquo;t see. But I know she was there smiling at me&amp;hellip; like I&amp;rsquo;m a little kid&amp;hellip; someone is sure playing with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a little booklet today titled &amp;ldquo;The Secret Language Of Flowers&amp;rdquo; by Rachel Ibarra explaining nicely what each flower means when you give it to someone. I&amp;rsquo;ve to confess, I&amp;rsquo;m not good at it and so have to depend on the lady at the check-out counter to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t buy flowers for my boss which would mean &amp;ldquo;secret love&amp;rdquo; on her birthday :). I can&amp;rsquo;t find this book on Amazon or B&amp;amp;N so you have to go to your nearest grocery store such as Pathmark to get it. Alternatively there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thegardener.btinternet.co.uk/flowerlanguage.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this nice web page for this&lt;/a&gt; but without pictures chances of screw up is high!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mars is going to be the closest to Earth in recorded human history so far. You can go out at midnight and look in the South and the big blob of orangish yellow light (which you might mistake as air plane) is Mars. Even on the rainy nights you can see it lurking behind the cloud - it&amp;rsquo;s that bright. Infect it&amp;rsquo;s brighter then anything after Sun and Moon! Even in a modest telescope you can see it&amp;rsquo;s big bright surface magnified as large as Moon. More info is in &lt;a href=&#34;http://urbanlegends.miningco.com/library/bl_mars_encounter.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Next Perseid meteor shower peaks on Aug 13, 2003. I&amp;rsquo;d spotted couple of shooting stars last week in just about two hours of time span and thought I was lucky! Well, this was the scientific reason behind it, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>T3 On DLP and Matrix II On IMAX</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/t3-on-dlp-and-matrix-ii-on-imax/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2003 05:54:05 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.imdb.com/Title?0088247&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terminator&lt;/a&gt; for the first time few years back, it had struck me like a lightening. Though most people considered it just another action flick, it was one of very few movies which I guess could change lives and sets the directions. And so to the date, it&amp;rsquo;s still my #1 favorite movie. I thought there won&amp;rsquo;t be &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.imdb.com/Title?0181852&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terminator 3&lt;/a&gt;. When I heard about it, seen previews and learned that director is not James Cameron, my prediction for it was to be a soulless sure flop. Well, I was wrong and right. It is flop and it&amp;rsquo;s sure not as influential as the original. But it&amp;rsquo;s still totally worth watching. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the best action film I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far. The car chase sequences are anything that you would have seen on the big screen (The car chase in Matrix II now looks like kids play). So it has become one of few movies that I&amp;rsquo;ve went out to see it twice. If it&amp;rsquo;s available in your area, choose the theater with Digital Projection (DLP) for fine DVD-like details on big screen. If you live in NJ, &lt;a href=&#34;http://movies.yahoo.com/showtimes/showtimes.html?t=Loews%20Jersey%20Gardens%20Theatres&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Loews Jersey Gardens Theaters&lt;/a&gt; is the place to go. Next, Matrix Reloaded is released on monster screens of IMAX. This is remastered edition rather then real IMAX movie but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to watch those special effects on 8 story screen :).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m running out of books to read so I was on shopping spree at Amazon.

      <title>Cool Pocket PC Stuff</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/cool-pocket-pc-stuff/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2003 06:13:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/cool-pocket-pc-stuff/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you got this thingy and don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with it besides storing phone numbers and birthdays, well, here&amp;rsquo;s some &amp;ldquo;secrets&amp;rdquo; I came across after my first night with it 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pocketgear.com/software_detail.asp?id=3004&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sexual Positions 1.0&lt;/a&gt; - Of course, this has to be the first to grab :). No freaky stuff in this one and it&amp;rsquo;s legally free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pocketgear.com/software_detail.asp?id=3176&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pocket Bartender&lt;/a&gt; - It&amp;rsquo;s so convenient to handover your Pocket PC to bartender and ask her to make that drink that no one else has ever heard of!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bisque.com/Products/TheSkyPE/TheSkyPE.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TheSky Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt; - This is probably the best and most popular in it&amp;rsquo;s category. Think about coming out of your car, tap on your Pocket PC to see real-time sky map and know the name of that star you been wondering about in the middle of nowhere. If you had good telescope, you can even plug-in your pocket pc in to it and control it with pen taps! Other such programs include &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nomadelectronics.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pocket Stars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stellarmetrics.com/Software/pu2000.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pocket Universe&lt;/a&gt;. The bad thing about TheSky is that there is no trial edition available but I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that you can make a copy in someway if someone else has it. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask how!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://home.comcast.net/~jonsachs/#Ephemeris%201.0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ephemeris&lt;/a&gt; - This is cool little app to show moon phase, sun/moon rise times etc. Helpful if you were like me who won&amp;rsquo;t mind not sleeping additional one hour to see sun rise!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pdawin.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TV Remote Controller&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to make this work but the basic idea is that you are sitting in the bar and suddenly TV channel gets changed to Star Trek from some stupid sports game and no one knows how did that happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfcen.com/pocket/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Taiyoukei&lt;/a&gt; - This is nice set created by a Japanese guy for astronomy. Taiyoukei meaning &amp;ldquo;solar system&amp;rdquo;, for example, can tell you which planets are up in the sky right now among many other stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EBooks - There are several free (the one on Kazza may not count) ebooks available which you can read on Pocket PC during your bus trips to New York. Special fun are kids books: Alice in the wonderland, Encarta Pocket Dictionary, Adventure of Tom Sawyer and Julius Verne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these cool stuff, Pocket PC as an operating system totally sucks. How one can even think of making it and selling it? There&amp;rsquo;s lots of scope here to make additions to this crappy operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/Blogger2dasBlog.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/Blogger2dasBlog-300x214.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Blogger2dasBlog&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-891&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/Blogger2dasBlog-300x214.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/Blogger2dasBlog.jpg 768w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; was previously hosted on Blogger.com and boy, that thing sucked. So my mission was to host my blog on my own site with an ASP.Net engine that I can customize and extend as I like. So DasBlog came along but there weren&amp;rsquo;t any tools around to fetch my blog entries from Blogger.com and put in to dasBlog. Sure I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to loose my previous entries, so I made my own conversion tool that does this export from blogger.com and import in to dasBlog. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good demonstration of how to use Blogger API, XML-RPC and use dasBlog engine. Infect you can use it with any host that supports Blogger API by changing server URI in Blogger.cs class. I used open source XML-RPC wrapper for .Net but had to tweak it and fix it a bit so this is more improved version :). You may note that, it imports entries in to dasBlog hosted on your localhost and not on remote server, so you will need to manually copy XMLs generated in Content folder on your local machines inetpub\wwwroot$$!dasBlog path]\Content to your remote server.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite online music service Rhapsody is not working for me these days. They &lt;em&gt;removed&lt;/em&gt; entire Linkin Park collection, few albums from Kid Rock and God knows what more. So I&amp;rsquo;m back to my old favorite Yahoo! Launch. They have gotten better with more selection, many more videos and more features. The best thing is, ofcourse, you can tell it what you liked and it will select more your kinda music rather then purely random songs. And it&amp;rsquo;s totally free! You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://launch.yahoo.com/lc/?rt=0&amp;amp;rp1=0&amp;amp;rp2=1214708279&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;listen to my own customized radio station&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;m listening to right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Star parties are event with all night deep sky observations and chance to meet other fellow amateur astronomers. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.princetonastronomy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;first one of the year at East Coast&lt;/a&gt; is happening this weekend at Hope, NJ. There&amp;rsquo;s usually crowd of 20-30 people with all level of skills. You can try all sorts of telescopes (some as large as 17&amp;rdquo;) and instruments for deep sky CCD observations and so on. There are going to be day time events, talks and presentations and sun spot watching! If you missed this, there is 3 more popular star parties coming up this year. Check &lt;a href=&#34;http://skyandtelescope.com/resources/calendar/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the event calander at S&amp;amp;T site&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.turnerclassicmovies.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Turner&amp;rsquo;s classic movie&lt;/a&gt; channel will be showing three &lt;a href=&#34;http://directory.google.com/Top/Regional/Asia/India/Arts_and_Entertainment/Movies/Hindi/Bollywood/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bollywood movies&lt;/a&gt; in a row on every Thursday starting 8 PM. This is on experimental bases for the month of June. The bollywood movies have an average opinion of being stupid, mostly same, colorful, frequent with dance sequences with no reason and something that makes most females burst out of tears all the time. But the movies that TCM was showing since past few weeks were some of the very best, including my rare personal favorites, that&amp;rsquo;s far away from this average opinion. So I guess it would be worth to check out their schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2003/06/testground.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2003/06/testground-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;testground&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-1099&#34; srcset=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/testground-300x225.jpg 300w, http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/testground.jpg 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.povray.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;POV-Ray&lt;/a&gt; is the 3D graphic software which allows you to create 3D world with lightings, reflections, shadows, color gradients, materials, textures and so on. I&amp;rsquo;d read about it about 5 years ago and almost ignored it - until just few days back I decided to gave it a whirl one more time (I think it was a sudden urge to create some 3D graphics). Just after a quick simple installation and spending 15 minutes on beginner&amp;rsquo;s tutorial, I was totally in to it. Just a couple of hours more and I&amp;rsquo;d &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2003/06/testground.jpg&#34;&gt;my very first 3D image which is cool enough to show off&lt;/a&gt;. By the time night fall, I already had an AVI movie with a virtual walkthrough in my 3D world (by making camera move along a specified trajectory). This thing is addictive and it rocks. I can now calculate 3D coordinates and linear transformations in my head! The scripting language it uses is C like and very intuitive. Sure there were many other ray tracing programs including 3D Studio but this open source free program is much more &amp;ldquo;programmer oriented&amp;rdquo; rather then &amp;ldquo;artist oriented&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.irtc.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Internet Ray Tracing Competition&lt;/a&gt; for some truly mind blowing virtual images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/PlayingWithPovRay&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Source code for my above first image is now at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new look[s] and content is soon coming to replace my current web site. This new version will feature something called themed site - i.e. I can make my site look like anything I want in minutes! This concept is not new but as I wanted to take care of all small details, it took me 30 hours of heavy duty ASP.Net programming and couple of missed meals last weekend to accomplish this - in most ideal way I could think of. Thanks to all rain and cool air coming from my window - which kept me working long long hours. There will be change in content too. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to delete some of them. So just in case, you&amp;rsquo;d liked it, save it in your own machine before it disappears! Apart from that, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving my blogs to my own blogging tool. These blogs are currently hosted on blogger.com and that thing SUCKS! They charge for their crappy blogging software and still 50% of the features I want are missing. I&amp;rsquo;m just tired of looking around for another blogging service and so I got to write my own - my next mission.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This place is becoming my luxury hike place on lazy drizzly spring days. It&amp;rsquo;s the highest point in state of New Jersey. You can see all neighbouring states Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New York on clear day and you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to hike to get on the top - just take 5 min easy drive and you are there! It has even little beach on the lake. You can view Mohonk, Catskills, Camelback, Pocono&amp;rsquo;s, Bear mountains - all from same place! It&amp;rsquo;s even better on drizzly days because there&amp;rsquo;s no one there and clouds are kissing the land :). Also, by far it&amp;rsquo;s the only perfect sunset view spot I&amp;rsquo;ve found in NJ. To get there, all you have to do is to be on Rt 23N. Just after few miles Rt 23 suddenly becomes all green and gorgeous. The country roads after the town of Franklin are cool enough to get lost for a while. I have a took &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dotphoto.com/go.asp?l=sytel&amp;amp;AID=810813&amp;amp;Pres=Y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;some pics - check it out&lt;/a&gt;! I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding few more soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Central Park summer stage schedule is out. Mark your dates from their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.summerstage.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;official home page&lt;/a&gt;. On 311, this is a new number you can dial in New York and ask any question or make any complaints - literally! This is due to effort of new mayor Bloomberg to combine several agency to one spot through one number! Want to know how to dispose refrigerator? or complain about that loud car alarm? Dial 311.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one fine spring morning, a beautiful lady with the sweetest voice decided to walk in a gorgeous park and sing for whoever cared. It was Saturday morning, one of the least busy time of the week when rest of the world prefers to sleep after long Friday night. It was one of the most invisibly promoted concert - even a professional certified guide at Central Park just 200 feet away from the stage didn&amp;rsquo;t knew about it! But still many of us did knew and hassled through early Saturday morning to be there. There were even fans who literally set up their front line spaces before sun came up. Then there was a &amp;ldquo;Jewel stalker&amp;rdquo; who tried a stunt to reach her with roses. Jewel being inherently very shy and sensitive, you don&amp;rsquo;t expect lots of fun fair on the stage. It goes smoothly with occasional emotional bursts until she feels comfortable with the whole thing. And then she can tell jokes and attempt to be funny. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to create exact replica of her album versions, instead almost always she would change tempo, tones and add twists. One often discussed disappointment was new hair style (change from the one with &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2003/06/jewel_intution.jpg&#34;&gt;long beautiful hair&lt;/a&gt;). She is sure my #1 favorite female artists and I been envy of people who heard her live when she still a coffee house singer. Her open air concert in the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest city and gorgeous park on that fine spring morning just looked like falling from the heaven. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dotphoto.com/go.asp?l=sytel&amp;amp;AID=810156&amp;amp;Pres=Y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Catch her few glimpse in my photo albums section&lt;/a&gt;. Her new album &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008OWZE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;0304&lt;/a&gt; is already in the stores and I guess she might have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jeweljk.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;more upcoming events&lt;/a&gt; in case you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/05/RepoMiscDevFiles20140613.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://shitalshah.com/ShitalShahWP/wp-content/uploads/2003/05/RepoMiscDevFiles20140613.png&#34; alt=&#34;RepoMiscDevFiles20140613&#34; width=&#34;210&#34; height=&#34;134&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1445&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the place I put any scripts, configurations worth saving. Some of the may be here from pure historical reasons so be careful in using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;copynewfiles-bat&#34;&gt;copynewfiles.bat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little batch file is just ROBOCOPY command line that I end up using too often. I&amp;rsquo;ve went through every command option to figure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;out if it should get in to this file. My main use of it is incremental copy of large folders for quick and dirty backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tidy1-cfg&#34;&gt;tidy1.cfg&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is config I created for HTML Tidy2 Plugin for Notepad++ after a lot of research. Goal of this config is to be robust and clean up even the mess as worse as the ones created by Microsoft Word. I use this anytime I have need to reformat HTML or fragments of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;git&#34;&gt;git*&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bunch of command lines that forms my Git workflow. I put these files in my global path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;xsetup-reg-obsolete&#34;&gt;Xsetup REG [Obsolete]:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This registry file is generated by X-Setup and contains lots of settings to make default Windows installation more suitable for geeks. This was usually the first thing I used to run after installing Windows until Vista came out. This is neither tested or recommended on later versions of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;bugdb-mdb-obsolete&#34;&gt;BugDB.mdb [Obsolete]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; says, Please never create yet another bug tracking system when your project finally needs it. While in the times of Github, basecamp and TFS, no one needs yet another bug tracking system, it used to be cottage industry just a decade ago. This file is my fair share in to the madness that I was forced to rig up in about an hour when frustration with other options just became unbearable. It&amp;rsquo;s bug tracking system entirely made up of MS Access in a single file! Customize all you want and take with you anywhere. If you are insane enough, please host it on your network share so everyone depends on it. And believe it or not, this little file had been actually used on real projects in early 2000s and people loved its simplicity and super quick customizability. This MDB contains all accessory queries, config data and data entry form to have you get started right away. Similar functionality is known to cost as much as $30000 :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/MiscDevFiles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MiscDevFiles is now archived at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Albums From My Favorite Artists</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/new-albums-from-my-favorite-artists-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2003 04:50:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/new-albums-from-my-favorite-artists-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Many of these albums are also available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://music.lycos.com/rhapsody&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rhapsody&lt;/a&gt;.] Suddenly all of my top 3 favorite artists have relased their new music albums during last few months. Unfortunetely all of these albums sucks. But anyway, because they are my favorite they will get metion here :). First, Matchbox Twenty has came up with new album &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006OFTZ/104-3078521-0712709&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;More Than You Think You Are&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, they continue in tradition of weired names for their albums (oh well&amp;hellip; who can make sense of name Matchbox Twenty itself?). I guess they have grown big in last few years but haven&amp;rsquo;t completely lost their touch. Some tracks are cool. It takes time, experiences, situation to get taste of music from these guys. So far I personally know only one person who likes Matchbox Twenty!! Next, Linkin Park is out with much-awaited &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008H2LB/104-3078521-0712709&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Meteora&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d though this will be something new and fresh but it totally smells like leftover of their previous hit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004Z459/104-3078521-0712709&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hybrid Theory&lt;/a&gt;. These guys have so much energy and imagination I&amp;rsquo;d thought it&amp;rsquo;s not gonna wear them down any sooner. Hopefully they have something cooler in pipeline. Finally, Jewel has got her new single Intuition out. She does hip-hop kind of thing for the first time and pretty much screws it up. She has her new full album &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008OWZE/104-3078521-0712709&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;0304&lt;/a&gt; set to be released on June 3, 2003. Hopefully that isn&amp;rsquo;t all that bad. So if these sucks, what&amp;rsquo;s cool? Listen to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006JJ1O/104-3078521-0712709&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane&lt;/a&gt;. If while listening some of the lyrics doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to make sense, just remember that this album is from duo of teenaged Russian lesbians (and yes, they are hot!). Another is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/artist/glance/-/73666/104-3078521-0712709&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Barenaked Ladies&lt;/a&gt;. These canadian guys had most of their releases in last decade, have huge followings and their concerts are considered to be one of the best to go for. Very cool guitar tabs seemlessly going with equally cool vocals and effortlessly flowing lyrics and hummable tunes. If you think they took cheap marketing uproach, wait until you listen to tracks like Pinch me, If I should fall or Light up my room. Yes, there is NO female member in the band, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure you won&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New York Shows</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/new-york-shows-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2003 16:13:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/new-york-shows-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two shows currently on in New York city and it&amp;rsquo;s last week for both (i.e. until 27th April 2003). One of them is International Auto show at 38th street and 11th avenue at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.autoshowny.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.autoshowny.com&lt;/a&gt;). You can open the doors of most commercial cars on display and sit in (including Hummer H2) to see how it feels like it. While this might be exciting for some people, I found it more or less boring. It&amp;rsquo;s like walking around a big parking lot. Except few Porches, Ferraris, Bentley and few concept cars everything else you can see on everyday roads in US anyway. The best car I saw was Bufori, a $110,000 machine which has 1930 classic looks from outside and ultra hi-tech from inside. The next event happening in NYC is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macys.com/campaign/flowershow/newyork/index.jsp?bhcp=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Macy&amp;rsquo;s Flower Show&lt;/a&gt; at Herald Square. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been there but the flyer says over a million flowers, 30,000 species from 6 continents are on display. Spring rulez. Try not to miss it :). Next on the list is Central Park Summerstage. This is a popular summer destination where professional artists performs live and free of charge. This year &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pollstar.com/tour/searchall.pl?By=Artist&amp;amp;Content=JEWEL&amp;amp;PSKey=Y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jewel is going to be there on 10the May&lt;/a&gt;. Jewel is one of my top favorites - probably the best female vocal on the planet. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for her concerts but there weren&amp;rsquo;t any so far and now it&amp;rsquo;s right here in central Park and that too free!! I got this alert from pollstar.com - these guys keeps keeps a watch on concerts and music events - but I can&amp;rsquo;t get additional information or varification for this event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Picks: Movies, Concerts And Art</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three movies that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss this season: 1. Chicago - A total classic. Very different. Nice screen play. Cool lightings and photography. These guys got nominated for 13 acadami awards and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised. 2. About Schmidt - A movie that gonna move you. Shatter you. Only for hard core reality fans. 3. The Guru - A cool hilarious flick on an Indina emigrant. Neat. Concerts: 1. Matchbox Twenty is on roll. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matchboxtwenty.com/tour.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here their schedules&lt;/a&gt; for NY/NJ area. 2. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nowrunning.com/eventsFolder/UnityOfLight/ny.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The unity of light&lt;/a&gt; - A concert by my favorite Indian artist A.R. Raheman. This will feature several other BIG artists from Bollywood music scene. Looks very cool to me. Art: The 50th anniversary of the discovery of the double helix is now being celebrated visually, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/14/arts/design/14BOXE.html?th&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;six different exhibitions in Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SyFastPage - Churn Out Those Web Sites Faster!</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/syfastpage-churn-out-those-web-sites-faster/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2003 19:15:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/syfastpage-churn-out-those-web-sites-faster/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2003/03/tools_icon.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2003/03/tools_icon.gif&#34; alt=&#34;tools_icon&#34; width=&#34;40&#34; height=&#34;40&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1124&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my private library to build ASP.Net websites with one goal in mind: build it fast! I&amp;rsquo;ve already exploited it in building 3 of the websites (including this one) and one of them was literally built overnight! So well, it proves the point. This is still evolving code and there is not much documentation right now but you can contact me for assistance. Here&amp;rsquo;s what this library contains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templated themed page framework&lt;/strong&gt;: This is easier and different then others. It basically allows you to specify HTML file which will become your template an then you can put markers in that HTML file to indicate where would you want your site title, page title, site logo, menus etc. This is incredibly easy to use and pretty useful if you have raw HTML website and you want to use web forms and other bells and whistles of ASP.Net. This framework can get you started in couple of hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigational menu server control:&lt;/strong&gt; Really simplified menu server control. You set up your menu hierarchy as well as XHTML menu templates in XML file and this thing will paint it on your page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ListSet server control:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the heart of the site server control. It is a templated list in nutshell which means you give it a template (UserControl/ascx file) and it would instantiate that template for each row of the data. Inside your template you can use expression like &lt;code&gt;DataBinder.Eval(DirectCast(Container, DataGridItem).DataItem, &amp;quot;columnName&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; to paint that row in a way you like. Later if you want to change the look, you just modify template and you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to recompile. It nicely separates data and UI. Also it is derived from DataGrid instead of Repeater so it supports paging and other funky features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Stuff:&lt;/strong&gt; Website comments infrastructure, Some Web UI helper functions, Data functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;obsolete&#34;&gt;
  Warning: This program was written circa 2002 and last updated around Jan 2005. It is currently considered obsolete. There are no plans to update it and no support is provided.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=https://github.com/sytelus/SyFastPage&#34;&gt;SyFastPage is now archived at Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My New Photo Albums</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/my-new-photo-albums-mar-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2003 09:30:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/my-new-photo-albums-mar-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d become little lazy in putting up my photos since last many many months but now I just looked back and thought these ought to be out there or at least some of them! So here goes my Saturday night updating my photo albums! But in this blog I want to talk little about taking photographs. First, you do not need bulky pricey cameras. The good photos you capture entirely depends on the angle, moment and your judgment rather then technology embedded in camera (gee, and you still call me a geek!). Almost all photos in all of my albums so far were taken from mere 1 Mega pixel digital cameras which had all necessary functionalities but weren&amp;rsquo;t the high end ones (HP C20 and Sony DCR-100). The key to get good photographs is just to get out more. And every time. Make your will exceed the difficulties posed by weather or other circumstances. For example photos in my new album on Verrazano bridge were taken on one of the cold day in winter with chilling winds. I still remember my hands were frozen at the point of getting numb even after wearing gloves and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold my camera still! Yet in other album on Sun rising from behind the New York City it was even more brutal - I&amp;rsquo;d forgot my gloves! You won&amp;rsquo;t feel the chilling winds in those beautiful photos but it were there. If you ask why others don&amp;rsquo;t have these photos, it&amp;rsquo;s for simple reason: they weren&amp;rsquo;t out there. One more thing, you might want to avoid any retouching of your digital photographs unless you really want to do some modern artsy thing. The only thing I would allow on my photos is resize and 90 degree rotate. However tempting it might be, absolutely no enhancements of any type - the world deserves the truth the way you saw it! Finally I must thank the pool of positive feedback last year for these photographs but I guess I do not consider myself an artsy or even dedicated photographer. Infect much of the time I intentionally do not carry my camera or don&amp;rsquo;t take a snap even if I had one. You do loose capturing some magnificent views but you don&amp;rsquo;t loose moments :). My new photo albums can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/p/category/photos/&#34;&gt;viewed from my site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploring The Undergrounds</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/exploring-the-undergrounds/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2003 04:43:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/exploring-the-undergrounds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how some of the most beautiful passions are shared by so few. Thanks to a re-routed email that dropped in to my Inbox telling me there was a presentation on &amp;ldquo;All about caves and caving&amp;rdquo; and I got a chance to meet people who are exploring these underground marvels since more then a decade. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much beginner and just had some idea how these caves would have looked like when I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140390839/102-5177515-0440154&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adventures of Tom Sawyer&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago (and this still remains the best book I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read!) and when I went out on one of the caving trips last summer with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.outdoors.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt;. It is simply breathtaking what this planet&amp;rsquo;s underground holds for you with miles and miles long caves nerves system frequently including super huge tall domes formations and sometime hundreds of spiky icy straws, deep pits and even lakes. These caves can be explored almost all year round because temperatures there stays stable between 50-60 F. However it&amp;rsquo;s complete darkness there and you got to have helmet with light and some other essential gear. It&amp;rsquo;s recommended that if you are beginner you go with someone experienced and never go in group of less then four. If you are a good hiker and have some rock climbing experience, it helps but all you really need is a will to crawl, scramble and be there! The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caves.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Speleological Society&lt;/a&gt; is your starting point to get in touch with gurus and go out in their group outings across United States and Maxico. If you are in New Jersey, visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nnjg.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Northern New Jersey Grotto&lt;/a&gt; to meet some of the cool experts in this field and start out in their trips designed for beginners!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one is cool artsy low-profile New York event. Nothing much happens: a celebrity comes on stage and reads you a short story. It&amp;rsquo;s an experience, given the right story teller, how much different a story becomes when someone reads it to you. Visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symphonyspace.org/genres/seriesPage?seriesId=29&amp;amp;genreId=4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Symphony Space&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt; to get more info on shows. I think shows will run through June. My last year&amp;rsquo;s favorite was one called Boys from the Best American Short Stories. This will probably be repeated this year too. But watch out for it, that had been a sold out show last year!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Finds: 7 Ethnic Tracks</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/music-finds-7-ethnic-tracks-jan-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2003 07:13:22 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/music-finds-7-ethnic-tracks-jan-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite &amp;ldquo;soul test&amp;rdquo; for a song had been to make someone listen to it who doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand the language and see if they can still figure out the meaning from rhythm and vocal emotions. All of the following tracks are &amp;ldquo;remixed&amp;rdquo; versions of original tracks (if there were any), have sweet vocals and certainly has a different style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[artist - album - song]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Forest - Pure Moods - Sweet Lullaby. Probably an African language. My guess for this song was that it&amp;rsquo;s a song for pre-marriage rituals and I was wrong for both guesses. You can find english translation from Internet but give yourself a try!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Forest - Boheme - Marta&amp;rsquo;s Song. This one is pretty old (released in 1995). Rest of the album is crap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karunesh - Global Spirit - Punjab. Probably a version of folk song in an Indian language Punjabi. Extremely popular 2002 hit in India. Karunesh is a German born artist who later came to India after near-fatal motorbike accident which started off his spiritual journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Khalid - Khalid - Didi. After you listen to Arabic languages you might wonder, if one can even sing in that. This old global hit might prove you wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DJ Aqeel - Ek Haseenna thi - Tu Tu Wahi. One of the Bombay style remix but with very cool vocals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant Karma - Dance Masti Again - Aaja Piya. Yet another Bollywood remix with cool vocals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bally Sagoo - Best of Bally Sagoo - Gur Nalon Ishq Mitha. The bhangra-style music is well known to make your feet move. And when that gets remixed by Bally Sagoo, it a definite dance hit. Much of the album is also not too crapy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Moving Around Mumbai</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/moving-around-mumbai-jan-2003/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2003 06:33:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/moving-around-mumbai-jan-2003/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I never liked the City&amp;rsquo;s new name &amp;ldquo;Mumbai&amp;rdquo; (from old Bombay) but it looks like that&amp;rsquo;s gonna stay. My favorite season to be in the City always had been Monsoon (June - Sep) when it rains a lot. However the weather in December is also pleasant 70s (F) and sky is still clear enough for me to spot some shooting stars. Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline few observations as a personal note. If you been to or away from this wonderful, dirty, soulful and one of the greatest cities in the world, here&amp;rsquo;s the treat for you :). The vegetarian and the non-vegetarian sects seem to have risen in equality in their strength and aggressiveness. Vegetarian burgers were already common place but now you can see vegetarian hot dogs on menus! I even saw the ad for vegetarian tooth paste! But on the other hand much of the college going crowed doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel any guilt in eating animals. However, vegetarian burgers are just &amp;ldquo;vada paw&amp;rdquo; with burger&amp;rsquo;s bun. The restaurant staff also informed me that hot dog has same material as burger but with different buns. Looks like the City is reinventing American food just as it did decade ago for Chinese food. Much of the &amp;ldquo;Chinese&amp;rdquo; food available on Bombay&amp;rsquo;s street is something that&amp;rsquo;s most Chinese people are not aware of! Bombay girls, on average, are more free from traditions, modern and sophisticated. However this might be more true for upper middle class and riches. It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual to find girls smoking in college campuses and no one even gives a second look. While I hate smoking, doing it just as free as a man could and without guilt is a good change. In the New Year&amp;rsquo;s party that I been to, the clothing style of the crowd there was undistinguishable from a posh nightclub in US. But then again, that party was sponsored by F TV, a new channel in Bombay on fashion stuff. Now there are many more cable channels available then before. However most western TV channel&amp;rsquo;s have &amp;ldquo;indianized&amp;rdquo; themselves to stay in the fierce competition. The MTV India is far far better in quality and presentation then its native US version. The cable internet is now easily available for nearly same cost as dialup, however numbers of hours are limited and you have to pay hefty sum for a modem. Mobile phones are extremely common place and that looks like a booming business. Most phones use European style SIM cards and have pay-and-go billing. The mobile text messaging (SMS) is very common and can be used across the glob (In US, the text messaging standards are different which makes it neither popular nor globally usable). One of the other visible improvements is the numbers of FM channels that has been mushroomed in the City. I found most of them had real good quality programming. That may not be surprising when you realize that most DJs on these radio stations are young and even possibly still college going crawd instead of government employees. So, you know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be cool and vibrant stuff. Radio Mirch is one of the nicer ones. There are many more shopping malls then before but still they are quite small (not even 1/4th) compared to giant ones that you can find everywhere in US and UK. Much of the things sold in these malls are direct imports and targeted for relatively rich mass rather then usual middle class. You can get almost anything that&amp;rsquo;s available in western countries: popular colognes, brand sun glasses, Boss home theater system, DVD + MP3 players, big screen TVs, Play Station 2 and so on. But one of the hard to find thing was Calvin Klein Eternity cologne which I&amp;rsquo;d forgot to pack with my luggage at last minute! These new malls are starting the change in retain business but most purchasing still happens in street-side small retail stores. However apart from more shopping malls, what city needs right now is more high rises. I saw old and small buildings being replaced by bigger and better looking ones (usually referred as &amp;ldquo;towers&amp;rdquo; in the City terminology). However these are usually still limited to 7 floors high. I guess much of the city&amp;rsquo;s problems like slum areas, unhygienic places and unorganized shops would be instantly solved by putting up real sky scrappers (50+ floors giants) everywhere like in New York and thus creating sufficient room to accommodate everyone nicely. Unfortunately lately I&amp;rsquo;d heard that some old residents had filed law suits against new high rises and so government is actively thinking about putting a ban on them. The sky scrapers is the reality that have to be accepted at one point or another. Later is not better. There&amp;rsquo;s no escape. Most people in Bombay feels that the City was improved in last few years by several new flyovers and highways. But it seemed minor changes to me and may even go unnoticed if someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you. Local trains now all have 12 coaches. I felt that the pollution in the City had reached to suffocating level. But you hear and see different things. One information board near Thane station said last measured air quality was rated &amp;ldquo;excellent&amp;rdquo; and that board itself I could see standing in smoke. I was guessing UV radiation would be much higher because of this but no one I knew was wearing sun block lotion. All &amp;ldquo;ricks&amp;rdquo; (3-wheelers) and taxies are now required to run on LPG gas rather then gasoline (&amp;ldquo;patrol&amp;rdquo; in City&amp;rsquo;s terminology rather than &amp;ldquo;gas&amp;rdquo; as in US). The drivers hate this law because of long queues to fill up with LPG gas. However from cost, pollution and maintenance point of view everything is better with LPG. I was wondering why LPG driven vehicles are completely absent from UK or US. Anyways, there&amp;rsquo;s fine of Rs. 200 for not wearing seat belts. Though few people cares and infect, taxies has no seatbelts at all even if you want to wear them! I&amp;rsquo;d later realized taxies even don&amp;rsquo;t have side mirrors!! The &amp;ldquo;usual&amp;rdquo; driving style in Bombay might make you loose couple of heartbeats. If you wish, you can even switch to totally opposite side lane so you can pass vehicle in front of you! No traffic fines. Even if you are on extreme right lane at the traffic light, you can still attempt to make a left turn. It&amp;rsquo;s ok. No one cares about divider lines between lanes. Infect for many, its fun to drive exactly on the center of a divider line! Most two lane roads would be used as 3 or 4 or even 5 lane roads. The only widely accepted &amp;ldquo;traffic law&amp;rdquo; seems to that more massive vehicle has a right of way. That means pedestrians, being the least massive things, has no right of way whatsoever. Peds just have to wait. If they happen to break this rule, you are allowed to honk at them. Honking is not an irritation but a normally accepted way of communicating between drivers (no pun). Even some trucks had signs &amp;ldquo;please honk&amp;rdquo; (to let me know you are behind me)! My friend told me that numbers of vehicles are now doubled in the City. But the surprise for me was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t saw a single car accident in entire period of month - something that I&amp;rsquo;m so used to see on Garden State Parkway in New Jersey once a week. That&amp;rsquo;s probably because of low speed limits of 40 KM/hr or less in the Bombay city. I do like to indulge in the conversation with cab and ricks drivers because they often have honest views and good info to share on lower middle class - though you have to take a risk of looking stupid at times if you haven&amp;rsquo;t been around for a while. Your visit is incomplete anywhere you go if you don&amp;rsquo;t sample local food, music, nightclubs and jokes. As far as food is concerned, Bombay is a heaven. I had hard time keeping off myself within limits. The sophisticated restaurants with cool innovative menus and interior decoration have mushroomed everywhere you would care. However, real food in Bombay is the street food. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss that because I haven&amp;rsquo;t found the taste equals even in acclaimed authentic restaurants outside India. The best street food heaven would certainly be the Chaupaty. However, it&amp;rsquo;s advisable that you don&amp;rsquo;t try everything in a single day (like me) because it might easily cause bad stomach problems or even typhoid. You do need some confidence and strong built-in anti-bacterial protection. However bonus is that while eating that stuff you can see a perfect sunset in the ocean, something that&amp;rsquo;s not usual on the East coast in US. Other places to see sunsets in Bombay are Band Stand in Bandra, Marin drive, Jogger&amp;rsquo;s Park and Worli sea face. All of these are cool places to walk around when it&amp;rsquo;s not crowdy. With perfect temperatures of 70s, mild winds coming over your face and beautiful sunset in front of your eyes nothing gets better. The notable one is the Jogger&amp;rsquo;s Park, a clean well maintained sea side place where I saw the last and probably the most beautiful sunset of the year. There was a funny sign in there &amp;ldquo;No Mis-behaving&amp;rdquo;! One of the City&amp;rsquo;s other places to have fun is Waterpark which is a heaven because of hot temperatures all year. This waterpark has put forward a claim for world&amp;rsquo;s biggest water coaster. Also one of the other visible changes in the City is so many brand new coffee houses. The one chain Italian coffee shop called Baristas is all over the City and they happens to have 10x better coffee then Starbucks and 100x better then Dunkin Doughnuts. Yeah, definitely. One of the changes that has struck me the most, painfully, is much more sharper division between lower and upper middle classes. It seems that the former&amp;rsquo;s family income has remained virtually unchanged over the last five years while the average prices of all none-essential goods seems to have been almost doubled. But it&amp;rsquo;s still amazing that most people seemed quite satisfied with their way of living. They didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to miss buying a portable CD player and or going out for playing 10-pin bawling. They think they have fun, they satiesfy their needs and they are rising. I think what constitutes this City is its people then it&amp;rsquo;s geography. Even under rising financial pressures, crushing work hours and increasing inflation, people are still good at heart as they ever have been. You can meet complete strangers, get along with them and have fun without caring each other&amp;rsquo;s last names or financial backgrounds. Only problem is that you might have to tell them that you gonna go away soon. Its might be as well less painful just to disappear&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flying is nearly every human&amp;rsquo;s dream and unstoppable desire. And now it&amp;rsquo;s possible to get enroll in to private pilot licence program, stay in a budget ($120/lesson without discounts) and see how the world looks from the eyes of the clouds! If you are a &lt;a href=&#34;www.startrek.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Star-Trek&lt;/a&gt; fan, you already know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. So get your feet off the ground and prepare to give that baby a little spin! Check out for the small airports around your area where you can almost usually find a flight training schools which may allow you to take a test or just walk-in lesson. And don&amp;rsquo;t worry. You will be putting your hands on very small planes like Cessna 152 which is fun to fly but you can&amp;rsquo;t really hurt anybody, ofcourse except yourself :-).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Good Books On Microsoft .Net Framework</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/five-good-books-on-microsoft-net-framework/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2002 20:05:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/five-good-books-on-microsoft-net-framework/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a programming world, to do a criticism against anything and everything Microsoft does is like putting up a fashion statement by beautiful models with their useless cloths. But after spending years in intensive computer programming, Microsoft .Net seems to be &lt;em&gt;the best&lt;/em&gt; computer programming environment human kind can possess at this point of time. It&amp;rsquo;s simply just too perfect (if you forget the stupid &amp;ldquo;.Net&amp;rdquo; name tag i.e.) converging several good stuff from lots of things that existed ranging from non-proprietary C++, rival Java, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s own VB and my old favorite Borland Delphi. I was kind of surprised at this level of perfection when I first used it and amazed at the numbers of human years that might have been spent to achieve this level of skills to do something this sophisticated flawlessly. So how do you get started? After going through details of more then 200 books, purchasing 10s of them, returning back many out of disappointment, here&amp;rsquo;s the 4 winners that has finally emerged. These books are probably all you need to learn almost everything you might need to develop advanced applications. I assume good familiarity with VB6, little more then intermediate programming experience and a desire to know low level details. [List arranged by order of importance]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735613753/104-1231289-1628722&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Programming Microsoft Visual Basic .NET&lt;/a&gt; - Francesco Balena. This one is an absolute must and covers almost everything in single volume. Fun to read and goes deep in to details. This is your ideal starting point if you were a VB6 programmer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672320681&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ASP.NET Unleashed&lt;/a&gt; - Stephen Walther. The ASP.Net is the most changed part between transition from VS6 and it&amp;rsquo;s the most exciting one. This book, I&amp;rsquo;ve found, is the best on the subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130622966&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;.NET Common Language Runtime Unleashed&lt;/a&gt; - Kevin R. Burton. Haven&amp;rsquo;t read this one yet but it looked really cool with MSIL and other low level stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130622966/104-1231289-1628722&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Compiling for the .NET Common Language Runtime&lt;/a&gt; - John Gough. You don&amp;rsquo;t know it until you get dirty with details and this book gonna take you in &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; details. I bought it to understand MSIL, virtual machine, common language issues and in future to make my own compiler for RPL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130622966&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microsoft ADO.NET&lt;/a&gt; - David Sceppa. The ADO.Net is the center of almost any large scale app and you need to know every little thing about it. While I&amp;rsquo;ve included this book in the list, I must admit that this one was a disappointment when I tried to find details on some advanced level stuff I was doing for real world application. But still it clears up lots of basics on concurrency handling, typed datasets etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, What&amp;rsquo;s not included in above books? First, the C# language spec is not included because you better off &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/csspec/html/vclrfcsharpspec_1.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reading it from MSDN&lt;/a&gt;. General tasks that you might perform every now and then are at &lt;a href=&#34;http://samples.gotdotnet.com/quickstart/howto/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Quickstart tutorials (the HowTo index)&lt;/a&gt;. However, none of the books that I came across really contains good application architecture strategies that you can use in real world. For this subject, you should check out articles at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devx.com/dotnet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DevX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fawcette.com/resources/spcollections/aspnet/default.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fawcette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://asp411.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;asp411&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asp.net/Modules/MoreArticles.aspx?tabindex=0&amp;amp;mid=64&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;asp.net&lt;/a&gt;. This might be your best bet when it comes to putting principles in to practice. Finally, here&amp;rsquo;s the books I returned: Instant ASP.NET Applications, ASP.NET Tips &amp;amp; Techniques and Programming Windows with C#. Beware!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book I&amp;rsquo;d bought for my brother who is a doc by profession but unfortunately he has to now wait until I finish reading it. While the lingo of biological sciences usually tends to scare us, I&amp;rsquo;d always a fascination for doctor&amp;rsquo;s life and this book is about it and more. The author takes you in the real stories that happened in his career as a trainee surgeon with a style that might put a fiction writer to a shame. The real beauty, however, is in the microscopic details. The philosophies involved in medical profession is embedded here with the wit and sharpness of a logician and that&amp;rsquo;s another stronger side of this book. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805063196/002-0203858-4756001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here to have a look&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Better Giving</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/the-better-giving-for-relatives-abroad-2002/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A year ago it took me around 6 months before I felt it was the perfect gift to give it to my cousins. But the trouble was that by the time they received it they got confused whether it was for last year&amp;rsquo;s occasion or coming year&amp;rsquo;s! It&amp;rsquo;s an art to find a gift that&amp;rsquo;s unique, hard to find, memorable and the one matching with person&amp;rsquo;s personality and need. Here are some of those tips and places that I came across over time to help you out this holiday season. 1. The premier destination to get the unique gift idea is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.surprise.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;surprise.com&lt;/a&gt;. A must visit if you are still in the complete darkness. 2. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my collection of gift links&lt;/a&gt;. You will find things ranging from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drugstore.com/qxp69153_333181_sespider/kama_sutra/weekender_kit.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kamasutra weekender kit&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://stardate.utexas.edu/giftshop/store.tpl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Astronomy&amp;rsquo;s cool gift ideas&lt;/a&gt;. 3. To find out what&amp;rsquo;s latest and coolest, check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?&amp;amp;articleID=00062C10-684A-1DDE-A838809EC588F2D7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Scientific American&amp;rsquo;s Top SciTech Gifts of 2002&lt;/a&gt;. This one is a real good contemporary compilation. 4. If you still didn&amp;rsquo;t found you were looking for, view &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my collection of shopping links&lt;/a&gt;. Specially check for Diversity Stores section. 5. Instead of giving gifts to someone who already has too much, you might want to ask them if it&amp;rsquo;s ok to give some donations to non-profit organizations instead of giving them yet another gift that would be anyway useless to them. Click here for some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;charity organizations in my links collection&lt;/a&gt;. 6. Finally here are my personal favorites and non-favorites for this year: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wizcomtech.com/products2/quicktionary2.php3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Quicktionary&lt;/a&gt;, Book light (both are perfect if a person is an avid reader), external hard drive (perfect for heavy laptop users because they always run out of space), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getfeetwet.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;handheld GPS&lt;/a&gt; (for outdoor person), &lt;a href=&#34;http://mindstorms.lego.com/eng/default.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lego Mindstorm robot kit&lt;/a&gt; (absolute perfect gift for kids), DVD/MP3 players, HP49 calc (perfect for mathematicians), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ehobbies.com/radio-control-airplanes.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;model air plane kit&lt;/a&gt; (prefer unassembled ones). And now the things that sucks as gifts: fragrances, cloths, pocket PCs and palms, organizers, CD players, pocket MP3 players, RC cars, PS2. These gifts totally suck. Finally it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to go overboard. Infect being a follower of &amp;lsquo;Grinch philosophy&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to hate all give and take of gifts. May be it&amp;rsquo;s just enough to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sytelus/Bookmarks&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;send a web card&lt;/a&gt; with few clicks to let someone know that you still remember.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shooting Stars Getting Ready To Fall</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/shooting-stars-getting-ready-to-fall-2002/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leonid meteor shower is slowing down every year but it&amp;rsquo;s still a magnificent event. I was fortunate to witness this heavenly fireworks last year at a mountain lake some 20 minutes away from my home and there was shooting stars falling down at the rate of one per second for the entire period of more then 15 minutes. Now that&amp;rsquo;s more shooting stars a person would otherwise see in his or her entire life time! Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t had too many wishes to make so came back home with just memories of bright lines meteors made and their reflections in the lake. This year it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be around 6 times less intense (that is only 10 meteors/min) but still that&amp;rsquo;s a lot!

      <title>Two IMAX Flicks</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/space-station-3d-starwars-epi-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just watched new episode of South Park and took my regular dosage of grossness, cursing and offensive language. Feels better&amp;hellip; love it! Ok&amp;hellip; now back to the bad stuff. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping track of new movies since past couple of months because all of them pretty much sucked but now here&amp;rsquo;s two IMAX movies that you might not be aware of and that&amp;rsquo;s gonna go away soon. Both are running at Loews IMAX theater (67th St and Broadway, New York City).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;amp;cf=info&amp;amp;id=1808393554&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Space Station 3D&lt;/a&gt;: This is the movie that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to absolutely miss. Watching this movie on huge 8 story high screen, with 42 speakers and in 3D is probably the next best thing to be actually there in space. It has been shot by actual astronauts with cameras in their helmets. The philosophical thoughts of us being something special is sure to trigger in your mind when you show those awesomely beautiful Earth views filling your entire eye sight on that huge screen. Photography of zero gravity environment, astronauts&amp;rsquo; daily lives and their way of having fun is just amazing. Recommended sit: The very first row!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;amp;cf=info&amp;amp;id=1808439536&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Star Wars - Episode II&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m not a Star Wars fan but this might be worth to check out if you have extra time and money. I&amp;rsquo;d watched Episode II when it came out earlier this year (it was than running at &lt;a href=&#34;http://movies.yahoo.com/showtimes/showtimes.html?z=10001&amp;amp;r=sim&amp;amp;m=&amp;amp;t=AMC%20Empire%2025&amp;amp;a=&amp;amp;dt=0&amp;amp;s=tm&amp;amp;p=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s digital cinema which is probably one of very few of it&amp;rsquo;s kind) but to say the least, it&amp;rsquo;s the weird story even for geeks! The IMAX version is not really re-created for huge screen and you can clearly see the low resolution distortions in graphic effects when it&amp;rsquo;s projected on that huge screen. However that chase scene with sky diving sequences in futuristic city are the real treat and totally worth on the extra large screen. The THX digital sound effect also works great. This movie has limited engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How To Get To Sleep Faster</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/how-to-get-to-sleep-faster/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2002 06:40:15 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not submitting ourselves to sleep is a problem for many of us. Here&amp;rsquo;s few of the ideas that I found works getting little closer to your dreams 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thing that almost always worked for me is to read real complex book filled with poorly proven math equations and undecipherable physics text (or some translated ones). It quickly drains out all extra energies and puts you in nice sleep (no pun intended)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on your air conditioner. The heat won&amp;rsquo;t let you die. The colder environment slows down body functions, helps to dry down the energy levels and drives you towards the kind of &amp;ldquo;stasis&amp;rdquo;. Note that you should never sleep without warm comforter/duvets in this case (even if this looks contradictory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new recent find that has also worked well: drink glass of warm milk before going to sleep! Well, actually it&amp;rsquo;s from all-wise &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.startrek.com/library/individ.asp?ID=112466&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Guineen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s character in Star Trek TNG. No wonder it works 🙂&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last one is to put on the run of classical music on very low volume. It isn&amp;rsquo;t very effective but it&amp;rsquo;s cool!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Some Books &lt;i&gt;About&lt;/i&gt; Programmers</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/some-books-about-programmers-2002/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2002 18:54:04 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/some-books-about-programmers-2002/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theweblogreview.com/review.php?id=2042&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;couple of reviews&lt;/a&gt; of my blogs at Weblog Review. Looks it aren&amp;rsquo;t all that bad after all :). This one is about the few cool books that I came across on programmer&amp;rsquo;s life, passions, dreams and thoughts. To tell you the truth, all of them has kept me awake until early mornings since past few months. If you are hard core programmer from the roots, you are in for the real treat! Be hold! The first on the list is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141000511/002-0203858-4756001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hackers&lt;/a&gt;. No, it isn&amp;rsquo;t about breaking illegally in to some computer system. It&amp;rsquo;s about the very first computer programmers who put their foot steps in to this new world - like a little curious girl entering in the wild magical world of fairy tales. But more than the technicality, the thing that will touch you, cut your skin and swirl through your soul is the stories of passion that these people had - stories that are now permanently carved in to every page of this little book. A wonderful work. After coming from work, I would usually tell myself that I&amp;rsquo;m gonna read couple pages and then I&amp;rsquo;ll got to sleep and almost always I ended up staying awake until 5 in the morning with my face little tired of all those smirks that passed by. I can see myself and my career like a mirror in this book. It&amp;rsquo;s like reading stories of your ancestors and identifying yourself - or more like explaining yourself why the way you are. I believe you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be techie to read this book - it&amp;rsquo;s more a testament than a technology on the heights of human passion that this profession somehow inherently needs you to posses. Second on the list is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306292/002-0203858-4756001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hard Drive&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s about Bill Gates and building of Microsoft during early years (1975-1990). Well, I never really cared about this (this is my first book on the subject) and my perception of Bill Gates was pretty much like &amp;ldquo;smart business man who got super lucky&amp;rdquo;. Above book, Hackers, however changed all that. I was actually shocked to know that Bill Gates is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; just another hacker - a hard core geek - just like many of others around. And I was just hooked up in to those stories - probably some of the coolest one in Software industry. Author has like picked up all tiny hilarious interesting details. I used to find myself spending hours in conversations about bits from this book and spreading laughs. You just can&amp;rsquo;t put it down! Last one and which I haven&amp;rsquo;t finished yet (I&amp;rsquo;m kind of saving it from reading it entirely) is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0029356717/002-0203858-4756001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Show-Stoppers&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s hilarious. detailed, passionate and revealing inside stories of one of the biggest software project ever under taken. After reading the Hard Drive I just can&amp;rsquo;t get enough to know about the Microsoft. This book takes from where Hard Drive leaves - the after 1990 era. And this one is very detailed and that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s more fun to read. I almost felt like a team member who lived in the NT team - feeling same pressure, finding ways to curse, getting ashamed for blunders and rejoicing for the final target that would be achieved. If you happen to live in programming world, this book is an &lt;em&gt;absolute must&lt;/em&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t Miss. For others, take it as an optional.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Music Finds</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/new-music-finds-nov-2002/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2002 06:03:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/new-music-finds-nov-2002/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I missed Central Park visit this Sunday. So now this is happening 3 years in row. Anyway, this blog is about the new cool music artists/albums I found in past few months. It&amp;rsquo;s starts with Linkin Park&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Theory. To say the least, this is the one we call it &amp;ldquo;a land mark&amp;rdquo;. Very artsy compositions, meaningful smart lyrics and the best part: hybrid of melody and metal. You can&amp;rsquo;t possibly miss this one. I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard so much &amp;ldquo;visual&amp;rdquo; music in such quantity and quality. No, you need not be &amp;ldquo;metal&amp;rdquo; guy to listen to this. However the word of caution: many of the lyrics and song styles in this album can drive you in to frustration, illusionary fears or induce suicidal thoughts. You do need to be strong to listen to this and very strong to enjoy it. Next on the list is Jewel. When I heard her voice for the first time I was almost stunned by the sweetness and soul embedded in her voice. And to this date, I consider her as the best female vocals on the planet. She writes her own songs though many of them I consider sucks (her poetry book is available on Amazon). Few totally outstanding numbers: &amp;ldquo;Absence Of Fear&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Time After Timely&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Break Me&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;My Hands Are Small&amp;rdquo;. The first one, the &amp;ldquo;Absence Of Fear&amp;rdquo;, I consider the best love song ever written and sung. Many compare (and occasionally mistakes) her to Cranberries but I guess the &amp;ldquo;souls&amp;rdquo; these two artists put in their songs have different identities. To hear Jewel is treat to ears and thanks to modern day technology, it&amp;rsquo;s available to entire world! I&amp;rsquo;ll include few of my old finds later but before I log out, here&amp;rsquo;s the very latest: DJ Sammy! I randomly picked up his new CD &amp;ldquo;Heaven&amp;rdquo; in the sale at Wiz hoping to hear some cool trans and I glad I did. This is almost perfect (11 out of 13 tracks are vibrantly cool) and easily the second best techno-trans album after Moby&amp;rsquo;s Play. Tracks are full of life and energy and there&amp;rsquo;s no repetition&amp;hellip; The creativity poured in this album is amazing. Most of the tracks are seamlessly combined with very cool female vocals from Yanou (though she hasn&amp;rsquo;t got much credit on front CD cover) - a voice with unparalleled sweetness, imagination and passion. Another peculiar quality of this album is that as you hear it too much, instead of getting dull, it keeps getting better - it&amp;rsquo;s been kind of longest lived CD in my car&amp;rsquo;s player (i.e. 5 days). You need not be trans-junkie to like this album. It will catch your ears whoever you are. Only thing, being an import CD (euro dance) it costs lot: $18 to $25.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Outdoor Clubs On East Coast</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/outdoor-clubs-on-east-coast-2002/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2002 20:39:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/outdoor-clubs-on-east-coast-2002/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are single or have hard time to make you friends get of bed to climb some mountains or paddle some rivers - well, here&amp;rsquo;s something that might interest you. I&amp;rsquo;ve found few huge and really cool organizations that engage themselves in doing some interesting adventure outings in groups. The biggest and the best of these is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sierraclub.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s purpose of existence is nature conservancy and awareness. Every week they have multiple outings - hikes, kayaks, group dinners, meetings and even outdoor movie shows! The places I&amp;rsquo;d visited with some of the hike leaders this summer were mind blowing, kind of secret gems&amp;hellip; They also have special singles outings which I guess is better place to find that special someone then anywhere else because people who you meet in these clubs are the ones who you can identify with yourself, the spirit of adventure and sense of exploration. The Sierra club is non-profit, has chapter in almost every state in US (I usually go out with NY and NJ chapters) and they excert high influence on US nature policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another huge organization is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.outdoors.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AMC or Appalachian Mountain Club&lt;/a&gt;. They stand out by the diversity and huge quantity of outings they offer - including everything from hiking, sailing, kayaking, tour of Brooklyn bridge, night time Central Park, ice caves, all summer softball at Central Park, camping at their own facilities, windjammer cruises, tree identification walks, a day at Coney Island and so on. In spite of these, I like them less compared to Sierra due to couple of reasons. They don&amp;rsquo;t publish their schedules fully on web and force you to get their printed book. That tiny book takes time to arrive and can easily get misplaced. Many of the hike leaders doesn&amp;rsquo;t have or disclose their email addresses and at many instances, you will find it hard to contact them by any means even if they disclose anything at all. While most the people you will meet are very respectable and pleasant in person, the Sierra&amp;rsquo;s flavor of openness and friendly feel is not as strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last organization on the list is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adk.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ADK or Adirondack Mountain Club&lt;/a&gt;. Actually this is the first one I came to know about before any other. While it&amp;rsquo;s small and locally focused on NY/North NJ, I believe it&amp;rsquo;s the most intimate and friendliest club around. But the coolest things they do which sets them apart from everybody else is their international and national adventure travel. The list includes week-long outings like staying with real Inuit people at Greenland in the way they live, hikes at Swiss Alps, England Coast-to-Coast, trekking with donkeys in France, Grand Canyon backpacking, Alaska rafting and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A last point: I&amp;rsquo;ve often observed that that age proportion at many of these vibrant exciting clubs is not well balanced: numbers of young people (in 20s) is strikingly and surprisingly less. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s responsibility of people like us to spread the word and keep these clubs and spirit alive in the coming time. So get out of the bed and go somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just finished making this blog page! Wow. It took exactly 5 hours. When I started, I was going to program this whole stuff by myself and almost on the verge of firing VS.Net. And then I saw this site Blogger.com. As per the 10 commandments of programming world, never spend time in writing programs which has been already done and which are reusable. And this site was great. I created a template so that user will see blogs as integral part of my site. No fuzz. Though I&amp;rsquo;d to pay $15 to remove ads. Other complains include lack of ability to post comments and no built in search engine. But otherwise, I nearly saved atleast 3 days worth of coding. I really wonder why I&amp;rsquo;ve started so late&amp;hellip; so many good things will now remain un-blogged&amp;hellip; lol.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Autumn Fall Foliage Long Drives 2002</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/autumn-fall-foliage-long-drives-2002/</link>

      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/autumn-fall-foliage-long-drives-2002/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve some more time and it&amp;rsquo;s my first day doing blogs so I&amp;rsquo;ll put down few more tid bits&amp;hellip; This one is about fall foliage travelling I did this year. Last year I went out to 3 day trip to New Hampshire and drove through much of the state. This year I decided to went down North-east Pennsylvania. The driving route at Bucktail State Park was listed as &amp;lsquo;one of the most beautiful spot to be&amp;rsquo; in foliage by Yahoo Travel newsletter. There is some 75 miles of Route 120 which passes through scenic mountainous areas and small towns. So I rented Mustang convertible and started the trip on 20th Oct. Passing through Rough 80 west from NJ to PA was absolutely stunning. Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t stop on highway to take photographs and there are not many view points on Rt 80. So just look around and drive slow. While entering on Rt 120 at Lock Haven, PA I realized the peak was already passed and there was around 40% or less leafs on trees. A big sigh! But this was anyway as predicted in Foliage report at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.FallInPA.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FallInPA.com&lt;/a&gt;. But whatever was left was still absolutely gorgeous. You can tell how beautiful the peak must have been looked like. So after passing Ronovo I decided to drive down south were peak was still expected. I took Rt 144 and I glad I did. This some 70 miles long road was continuously covered with fall colors, passing through deep forest, valleys in curvy snaky ups and down fashion. What a treat! Next year I&amp;rsquo;ll be back here with proper timing :-). Anyway this was not my first trip and not the last also for this year. The first trip I did was to Windham, NY at Catskills. It was annual ADK (www.adk.org) fall weekend with lots of hikes in around the area. I did the 3 summit hike at Thomas Kole (6 mil) and one another 4 miles hike next day. Fall colors were just starting to appear. You can look at photographs on my web site &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ShitalShah.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.ShitalShah.com&lt;/a&gt; or their real host at www.dotphoto.com (the name of the album is First Of Autumn). The next fall color trip WILL be at NYC this weekend at Central Park. I&amp;rsquo;m missing Autumn at NYC since last two years and it&amp;rsquo;s hardly 40 mins away from my home! Sure NYC is jungle of building but Central Park is just a magical place. I saw some Central Park foliage shots in movie Autumn in New York (it appears just when movie starts, good because you don&amp;rsquo;t need to see rest of the crap). This weekend I guess is peak weekend in Central Park.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Pen With Dictionary And Voice</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/quicktionary-the-pen-with-dictionary-and-voice/</link>

      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/quicktionary-the-pen-with-dictionary-and-voice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now this is something I was absolutely looking for. A device which scans the printed word in a book and tell you it&amp;rsquo;s meaning and pronounces it through voice! Sure there are lots of hand electronics dictionaries for this but it&amp;rsquo;s still work half done because you have to cut your chain of thought and type in word in it. Guess what, there a pen shaped hand held scanner that does the same thingy - you just move it over a text and in seconds it gives dictionary entry and pronunciation! It&amp;rsquo;s called QuickLink or Quicktionary handheld scanner pen. The mfg site is at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wizcomtech.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.wizcomtech.com&lt;/a&gt; but sadly isn&amp;rsquo;t available at stores like Best Buy. All of the e-tailers including buy.com and amazon.com I tried were mysteriously out of stock and the manufacturer has kept their direct prices higher then any retailer (this really sucks). I will be buying a version called SuperPen - that one you can also use for storing lines of text you have jotted down and transfer to your PC later. Also it can translate scanned text in to many languages. very cool! Past few months I came across many many cool books and I wished if had this thing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gizmos - Backup Drive, USB TV, External Dolby Sound Card</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/gizmos-backup-drive-usb-tv-external-dolby-sound-card/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2002 00:13:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/gizmos-backup-drive-usb-tv-external-dolby-sound-card/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the very cool gizmos I&amp;rsquo;ve found: I was looking for a backup device for a long time. I&amp;rsquo;ve some 200 gigs of stuff scattered around and I realized much of it isn&amp;rsquo;t really junk!! So gave thought on DVD writers but I have no wish to carry 20 DVDs around. And then suddenly I found this 120GB external hard drive. It&amp;rsquo;s perfect. One from Iomega comes for around $290 and it&amp;rsquo;s 7200 RPM (look in Amazon). Another thing on my wish list was portable TV tuner card which I can connect to my laptop or home PC. It might surprise you but I&amp;rsquo;ve gave up on those &amp;ldquo;idiot box&amp;rdquo; type TVs since around year and half. I&amp;rsquo;ve Radeon All-In-Wonder showing TV on my 20&amp;rdquo; PC screen. And then there&amp;rsquo;s Creative 5.1 Dolby card which sends sound signal from my PC to 600W home theater system. Neat, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? I can use sophisticated program search, record program on my huge hard drives in MPEG, take stills and even view all channels at once (very slow though). But my PC died few days ago. It won&amp;rsquo;t power up because of that buggy CLSUS II motherboard bug. And now I&amp;rsquo;m missing South Park and Seinfeld. And so I realized I need to have something that I can plug in to my notebook on the go and watch TV! And I found more the what I asked for. For $80 you can get KWorld external USB TV tuner device which is also an FM tuner! It works on PAL also so good for travelling with laptops to UK and India. Watch out for few others like WinTV - they don&amp;rsquo;t have these things. Yet another thing that I was looking for was external Dolby 5.1 sound card. For those who have bought expensive computer speakers, well, guys you wasted your money. You can always get 600W home theater system (i.e. amplifier and speakers) and connect it to Dolby 5.1 compatible card. Until last year only such card was Creative Live! 5.1. Now there are many but I guess Creative still rules because they give you optical as well as SPDF outputs. The beauty of external card is that you can carry it with your notebook and instantly start a sort of night club wherever you can find amplifier and speakers (say, your friend&amp;rsquo;s bachelor party) streaming out your favorite MP3s. As you might know, most non-geeks who have home theater systems don&amp;rsquo;t know how to connect it to PC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog&amp;hellip; wonder why didn&amp;rsquo;t started this already! First what&amp;rsquo;s Astrila? I can&amp;rsquo;t tell for sure but it probably means &amp;ldquo;sparkling snow in star light&amp;rdquo; in Eskimo&amp;rsquo;s language. Well some don&amp;rsquo;t agree however. I&amp;rsquo;ve my personal web site at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ShitalShah.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.ShitalShah.com&lt;/a&gt; - that&amp;rsquo;s my name Shital Shah. This blog I&amp;rsquo;ll be using for jotting down quick unbacked findings and here&amp;rsquo;s few samples. I&amp;rsquo;m always on look out for new music. Already have few thousand songs here and there, but too much is not enough! There are now two online music services available: Yahoo&amp;rsquo; Launch and Lycos&amp;rsquo; Rhapsody (it&amp;rsquo;s playing &amp;ldquo;Pure Moods III&amp;rdquo; right now on my laptop). The Yahoo Launch is free and it will sequence up the new music for you by looking at your likings and ratings. Very cool. It did correctly picked up many of my favorites from some of the sample ratings I gave to it. A relief for someone like me who have exhausted out of choices. It has tons of online free videos. That&amp;rsquo;s super cool because MTV sucks at showing music videos these days and I desperately needed some on-demand music video service. And here it goes! Saying that, however, Launch collection isn&amp;rsquo;t really very big - i.e. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have 10s of thousands of songs - just few thousands. There steps in the Rhapsody. They charge $10/mo and you can listen online to their collection of some 10000 CDs. It&amp;rsquo;s like carrying that many CDs to your work or a hotel or Starbucks :-). You can even burn selected tracks to CD for $1/track. But there is no videos. Many of my favorites I found there: Matchbox 20, Lincoln Park, Enigma, Moby&amp;hellip; Some I didn&amp;rsquo;t found were Jewel, Enya and many others. So it&amp;rsquo;s kind of balanced collection but imagine, full CDs - right there waiting to get played! These days if anybody recommends me any album/artists I first listen on Rhapsody and they think about buying it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spring is here and so the refreshing blooms! Take a closer look to nature&amp;rsquo;s refreshing beauty by knowing the trees better. Can you identify at least 5 tress you will meet on the roads? Which tree doesn&amp;rsquo;t loose their leaves in fall? Is male and female flowers separate for this one? That&amp;rsquo;s just few questions you might. Get the pocket book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/158238133X/qid=1018245256/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-6492949-7167901&#34; title=&#34;Books on trees&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trees : A Guide to Familiar American Trees&lt;/a&gt; . If you are leaving neat New York city, visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centralpark.org/&#34; title=&#34;NYC&#39;s Central Park&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt; - An ultra cool place for hang out. If you live somewhere else, search for the botanical gardens in your area or move on to road trips to state parks. Also check out the books on identifying flowers at &lt;a href=&#34;http://amazon.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Garmin eMap GPS System</title>
      <link>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/garmin-emap-gps-system/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2002 21:35:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shitalshah.github.io/p/garmin-emap-gps-system/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2002/06/gps_emap.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2002/06/gps_emap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gps_emap&#34; width=&#34;79&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1183&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPS device keeps contact with satellites and tells you where exactly are you (usually with accuracy of 20m or better) in detailed street level map. You can ask it to go somewhere and it will show you arrows pointing direction where you should move. It can even tell you where are the nearest restaurants, restrooms, shops and so on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Many map related features may available only for USA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pluspoints&#34;&gt;PlusPoints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model from Garmin is one of the most advanced pocket GPS. Maps are really accurate sometime showing even very small corner shops! It tell you at what speed you are moving, how much time it would take it to reach destination. You can type the mailing address and it will locate it on map and direct you there!! You can make a search on nearest gas station, hotels, tourist attractions, night clubs, hospitals an so on. It will tell you where exactly it is, it&amp;rsquo;s phone number, how far is it and an real time arrow showing how to get there. It even gives you phases of sun and moon. You can zoom and pan the map. You can mark points on map and name them (it&amp;rsquo;s called waypoints) and you can even record where you are passing through and trace it back to get home! You can type in the mailing address and/or zip code and get there. Or you can know the postal address of place you are standing on! The built in memory can store street map of one of the US state. But fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s expandable and I usually keep maps of NY, NJ, PN always there. &lt;em&gt;These features are important, don&amp;rsquo;t buy without them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Many map related features may available only for USA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;minuspoints&#34;&gt;MinusPoints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find a way to mark your current location as a waypoint (bad if you want to come back there again and you didn&amp;rsquo;t knew how did you got there). There is NO real time built in compass - the biggest drawback compared to Magellan&amp;rsquo;s model. However latest problem I&amp;rsquo;ve faced since last few months is that the power switch doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on random occasion (no! I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything!). It really sucks when you keep pressing that button when you really need it and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cost&#34;&gt;Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GPS + extra 64MB memory + Metro guide CD + PC cable + car adapter + leather pouch = $450, December 2000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;betterthenthis&#34;&gt;BetterThenThis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is equivalent model from Magallen and it has buit-in electronic compass but then some other features were missing. But I guess Garmin eMap is the best available general purpose GPS for this price as on December, 2000. There are other models with color screen but very pricy and less on features.&lt;/p&gt;

  The list of one&#39;s favorite sites is a mirror of his/her&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; personality and interests. I always try to keep record of all the sites I ever visit (my bowser&#39;s History option is always set to maximum!) and keep the&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; interesting links in organized way. For an avid power surfer like me it&#39;s nothing less then secret box of treasure. And for the first time, over 1400 links to sites I&#39;ve collected over last 3+ years&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; is now public and downloadable! You can extract the zip file in to your browser&#39;s bookmark/favorite folder and check them out. I consider this&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; collection as one of the most important thing available on this site. So go ahead and try it out!

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2002/06/mp3_player_memorex.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://shitalshah.github.io/images/posts/2002/06/mp3_player_memorex.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mp3_player_memorex&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;111&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1184&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A personal CD Player that can play audio CD as well as MP3 CDs recorded from PC. Each MP3 CD can contain 150 songs. So just 3-4 CDs may have all songs you ever want to listen! Especially if you are on long drive, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to carry tons of CDs with you and flip them around all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pluspoints&#34;&gt;PlusPoints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model from Memorex had most features I wanted. Infect it was the only one during Christmas, 2000 which had those features like search, DSP, good antiskip, support for 132K+ bit rate, CD-RW compatibility, car kit, MP3 tag support. &lt;em&gt;These features are important, don&amp;rsquo;t buy without them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;minuspoints&#34;&gt;MinusPoints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size is slightly bigger the normal CD player and it&amp;rsquo;s bit heavy. The biggest problem is however it doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember the last play mode and song position when you turn on the power again. The random play mode, which I use 90% of the time, is not default. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t switch to external power from battery (like a laptop) when it becomes available. Also antiskipping doesn&amp;rsquo;t seems to be happening. Another really bad thing I experienced was it corrupts normal auto CD! After I play my normal audio CDs couple of time it usually becomes useless! But no harm done at all to MP3 CDs. But this is my guess and my CDs were getting older. Also I think some of MP3 files, specially those with very high bit rates, might not get played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cost&#34;&gt;Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;130 (Dec 2000)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;betterthenthis&#34;&gt;BetterThenThis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading The Bad Part above, well, this can&amp;rsquo;t be the best. I bought it when MP3 CD players were just arrived in market and there were only 2 models there. I guess there are atleast 5 models out there probably more near perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.compusa.com/&#34; target=&#34;new&#34;&gt;CompUSA&lt;/a&gt; store. Amazon.com sometimes have good discounts however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. It does following of things: \ 1. Adds/removes line numbers from projects in a group. Unlike other add-ins, this one has been thoroughly tested on live complex projects for more then a year and has lots of code to workaround VB IDE object model bugs. It also does smart numbering (for example it won&amp;rsquo;t number trivial assignment statements in Property Get). 2. This add-in can also add error handlers in all methods. Again unlike other similar utilities, this one has been thoroughly tested, accepts a directive to turn off error handler and has some decision making code to decide whether an error handler would effect actual logic. 3. Fix for VB&amp;rsquo;s recent menu item bug (MRU) (you might have noticed VB&amp;rsquo;s Recent project item menu always gets messed up). is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0.

&lt;p&gt;I believe websites should give away their source code if you&amp;rsquo;d created it just for fun and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for money. So yes, here&amp;rsquo;s the source code of this whole website itself! Points of interests: SiteData.mdb contains most of the data in relational format which you can query, lots of examples of user controls that I use as templates in DataGrid rows and it is a good example of how my SyFastPage framework actually gets used. The code may be slighly out of date as I do not plan to always keep it synchronized. This website is active since 1998 and its implementation had moved from HTML/JavaScript to ASP to finally its present day ASP.Net. The source code contains only most recent implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those strange music notations always made me curious. How is it possible &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; the music? Will I ever be able to read these notations and play a piece? Can I jot down the notes of GNR&amp;rsquo;s Sweet Child Of Mine while I hear it? I read that some of the masters never really played few of their creations - it was all in their minds and then in to paper!

&lt;p&gt;Unix users have taken for granted automatic insertion of a random quote-of-the-day in their emails since ages and that&amp;rsquo;s something Windows users still can&amp;rsquo;t do with their brilliant Ver. 10 of Microsoft Outlook. The situation usually gets unnoticed until you start getting those emails with quotes from a Linux guy and you find yourself incapable of &amp;ldquo;responding&amp;rdquo; with the similar cream-at-the-bottom. That was yesterday, however. The Outlook Quote is the cool answer to the quest and it does it all and more. It has very elegant user interface, extensibility, ease of use, ease of installation and complete seamless integration with Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to maintain several source branches in SourceSafe and constantly retrofitting your code around, this application can be tremendously helpful. It looks in to two specified SourceSafe folders, goes through all the files in them and finds out which files are different and performs various analysis in smarter way so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually check diffs manually. This application is in state of easy clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

Here&amp;rsquo;s small utility that might do the trick. It goes through all your vbp, frm, ctl and replaces GUIDs of crazy OCXes with ones that you have. This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You will have to find out GUIDs of OCXes installed in your machine and replace it by hand in the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are like me you would be maintaining backups of things ranging from your favorite links to ICQ logs on writable CDs. But there is a snag. There would be lots of files on your disk that has names more then 60 characters - like the .lnk file in your Favorite folder! And that crashes the CD writing process regularly because normal CD file system doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow longer names. Solution? Sorten it! With this utility! This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You might have to modify the source code for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual to see &amp;ldquo;Missing References&amp;rdquo; when you open the VB project and then take the pain of correcting them by hand. If it has became your daily routine and you are really tired of that, here&amp;rsquo;s the magic VB Add-In that will save you from that! This add-in monitors the state of references when you open the VB project. If it&amp;rsquo;s Missing or not proper, it will look in to VBP file and try to locate the DLL and correct that bad reference for you! Besides everything else, it shows how to write self-installing VB Add-In and some cool add-in techniques. If you said WOW, head on for download!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most wanted feature from users point of view in MS SQL Server is capability to generate INSERT scripts for MS SQL Server data. But call it Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s ignorance, this feature not supplied since quite long. And even worse, there is no public domain application to do that. This feature is usually desperately required in situation like sending test data to somebody or supply sample data. So I decided to write my own. It&amp;rsquo;s still isn&amp;rsquo;t the perfect and can&amp;rsquo;t handle all of the possibilities but it could be your best bet with supplied source code! This application is right now in state of easy installation but no on-line help is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have Windows network with NT Server in your organization, you have now ability to send messages to users that will popup on their screens all of the sudden. This is similar to how you get the message box on the screen when printer completes the printing. Administrators can use this app to send message to users asking them to log out. Or may be you just want to ask a colleague to come for a coffee! This application is right now in state of easy clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This application scans the given folder and sub folders for VBP files, analyses which VBP file references which ones and generates a Tree view showing this relationships. What&amp;rsquo;s more, it stores this analysis results in Access database so that you can run your own query or open it at later time. This utility is typically useful if your project consists of tons of VB components calling each other and if you wish to see what will be the impact of changing interface of one on other components. You can also use it to just document component relationships between your projects. This application also shows you how to analyze VBP file contents and ready-to-use source code.

&lt;p&gt;Concept of trojan horses is not new. Programs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shitalshah.com/www.bo2k.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Back Orifice 2000&lt;/a&gt; silently stays in background in your PC, acts as TCP/IP server and allows somebody to connect it through Internet and execute commands sent by them. The REA2 (Remote Execution Agent) is my own trojan horse specifically designed for silent, full proof, reliable and powerfull intrusion and control. I crafted this gem in about 5 hours and comparing with BO2K, it lacks few features like real time screen display and mouse control and plug-ins but it&amp;rsquo;s designed to be much more &amp;ldquo;reliable and silent intrusion&amp;rdquo; and has some more capabilities then BO2K. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Delphi 3.0 to eliminate any runtime requirements. The EXE available here is a server. You can use any client that can connect to it on port 23145 and send the command as strings. My favorite client is my own PortTalk. I didn&amp;rsquo;t got much time to document these stuff (as usual it was fun program solely meant for me) but you can get the list of commands in TMainForm.ProcessReq function in main.pas file. This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You might have to modify the source code for your needs. However you may freely contact me for the assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt that your time goes faster then the speed of light? Or have you ever had hard time to recollect what exactly you did whole month while filling your employer&amp;rsquo;s timesheets? Or have you ever had desired to analyse how much portion of time you spend in meetings and reading emails? Or have you ever wanted to keep Star Trek style daily logs but never maintained it? Well, then this application is just for you! Once installed, AutoActuals will pop up on your screen at regular intervals and ask you what you were doing! And it&amp;rsquo;s far more then that. It allows you to categorize your tasks, gives you hint on what program were you running all the time, generates reports in Word, maintains data in Access, supports multiuser access, supports task assignment and tracking by project managers and lot lot more. And all that in very simple intuitive UI! This application is right now in state of easy installation and no on-line help is available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PortTalk - Talk To TCP/IP Servers</title>

&lt;p&gt;This 2 year old application is still the gem of it&amp;rsquo;s own. You can use this program to connect to any TCP/IP server, send it some commands and see how server responds. I used this program to learn how exactly browser makes request for a page to HTTP server or how other TCP/IP protocols like Ping and Time works. I started out my TCP/IP programming journey by reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rfc-editor.org/&#34; title=&#34;Request For Comment Documents By Internet Engineering Task Force&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RFCs&lt;/a&gt; on different protocols and actually experimenting with them using PortTalk. I&amp;rsquo;d made even my own HTTP server and utilities like PortTalk were indispensible while testing them. The advanced version allows you to connect to to REA2 server (see below) and do a file transfer. This application is right now in state of easy clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  Over the time there were several programs penned out of my PC for use in development activities, to do some &amp;quot;hacking&amp;quot; or just have plain fun. Most of them were either known to my collegues or just by me until I realized that some of those tools were really &amp;quot;most wanted&amp;quot; by other software developers too. So it&#39;s now all here. Because of time constraint I wasn&#39;t able to document all of them or even make bit more user friendly but I guess person passing through same situation as mine would find it quite useful.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
